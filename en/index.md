Hi, I'm Hao-Yung Weng, a passionate coffee enthusiast. My coffee journey began when I led the [student coffee club at National Taiwan University](https://instagram.com/ntu.coffee), where I currently serve as a mentor for new members. Our club has a strong focus on research. We delve into blog posts (favorites include [Jonathan Gagné](https://coffeeadastra.com/), [Christopher Feran](https://christopherferan.com/), among others), host cupping sessions, document our brewing, and measure extraction yields.

Over the years, my coffee exploration has yielded numerous insights. While I don't claim that all my discoveries are conclusive, I believe they are worth sharing. This blog serves as a platform for me to express my thoughts and experiences, and my background in Computer Science has proven surprisingly beneficial in this endeavor.

The name of this blog, "why coffee?" was inspired by my initials, "WHY." This question can also serve as a point of reflection for all of us: What draws us to coffee? Is it the pursuit of experiencing diverse terroirs or the joy of engaging in discussions about the nuances of coffee with fellow enthusiasts?

In the past, when hosting tasting events, I often used the phrase "connections between people" to describe the meaning of coffee. From planting, harvesting, processing, and roasting, to the final cup of coffee, each bean has gone through a long journey, and this journey also connects the people involved. Usually, at this point, I would say to the audience, "You see, you and I, are also connected because of coffee."

In that same spirit, I extend this camaraderie to you, dear reader.
