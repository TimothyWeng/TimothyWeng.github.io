Hi, I'm Hao-Yung Weng, a passionate coffee enthusiast. I previously led the [student coffee club of National Taiwan University](https://instagram.com/ntu.coffee) and currently continue to play a role in nurturing new club members.

We regard ourselves as a relatively research-oriented organization. We read blog posts (we love [Jonathan Gagné](https://coffeeadastra.com/), [Christopher Feran](https://christopherferan.com/), and many more), conduct cupping sessions, log brews, and measure yield. Our goal is always to brew better coffee.

Through years of research, I've gained many new insights into coffee. While I can't claim they're all correct, I believe they're worth sharing. That's why I decided to use this blog as a medium for sharing my thoughts and experiences (this is one of the few times my Computer Science degree comes in handy).

Since my name's initials spell out "WHY," I decided to use "why coffee?" as the name of the website. This might also be a question worth asking ourselves: Why do we drink coffee? Is it to taste different terroirs? Or to enjoy the process of discussing coffee with fellow enthusiasts?

When hosting tasting events in the past, I often used the phrase "connections between people" to describe the meaning of coffee. From planting, harvesting, processing, and roasting to the final cup, each coffee bean has been on a long journey, and this journey connects the people involved. Usually, at this point, I would say to the audience, "You see, you and I are also connected because of coffee."

Similarly, I'd like to extend this message to you, the person reading this right now.
