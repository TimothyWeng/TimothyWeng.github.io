#### The Most Anticipated Pour-Over Cup of 2023: [NextLevel Pulsar](https://nextlevelbrewer.com/shop/nextlevel-pulsar-brewer/)

Jonathan Gagné in *The Physics of Filter Coffee* (also available in [Chinese version](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010937126)) mentions his ideal pour-over cup: [a cylinder shape to reduce bypass, even water distribution at the bottom to maximize the use of the filter paper, and a valve to control the flow rate](https://coffeeadastra.com/2023/09/13/the-pulsar-dripper/). Unexpectedly, readers within the NextLevel company, which had previously launched the LVL-10 pour-over cup, decided to collaborate with Jonathan to create this ideal pour-over cup as he envisioned, and named it Pulsar (Pulsar), not only echoing Jonathan's profession in astronomy but also because it alludes to the major feature of the pour-over cup: the ability to freely control the flow, even to the point of pausing it, thanks to the valve.

After the collaboration was announced, coffee enthusiasts around the world began the lengthy wait, which lasted for two years. Finally, in August 2023, Pulsar announced it was accepting pre-orders, and I quickly bought two. After another month of waiting, I finally got them.

I immediately started exploring Pulsar, but must honestly say, the process was arduous and disappointing.

#### The Problems I Encountered with Pulsar

The general consensus about Pulsar is that it excels in reducing bitterness, but I personally don't feel that way. In the suggested parameters for Pulsar given by Jonathan Gagné and most people<sup class="footnote-sup">[B]</sup>, the number of pours is high, this is because the goal is to have as low of a water level as possible to reduce pressure, Jonathan believes this helps in reducing bitterness. But after many tries, tweaking the parameters in various ways, I still feel the performance in bitterness reduction is not up to my expectations.

I suspect this is due to excessive disturbance. The multi-stage pouring, although keeps the water level low, also increases disturbance. Observing the coffee bed while brewing with similar parameters often reveals an uneven coffee bed, this might also cause uneven water flow. **The core issue lies in the height of Pulsar, to ensure a large enough capacity, the water distributor of Pulsar is too far from the coffee bed, leading to the disturbance being much more significant than I expected, even with the water distributor**.

Before getting Pulsar, I expected it to be much better than the Tricolate, but after nearly 20 brews, I still feel that the brews made with Pulsar were not significantly better than those made with the Tricolate in terms of flavor and data, which was somewhat disheartening.

#### Discussion with SEY Lance

I happened to know that SEY was also testing Pulsar recently, so I asked Lance about their parameters.

Lance and I had similar thoughts, he believes the biggest challenge is "how to achieve the highest extraction rate with the least disturbance", and this was also the main focus of my previous article. After many exchanges, corrections, and over 50 experiments of my own, these are my final parameters.

#### Parameter Introduction

Below are detailed parameter introduction and brewing steps, most parameters are completely the same as the previous recipe:

- Coffee-to-water ratio: 18g:360g (1:20)
    - Please don't use more than 20g of coffee, because the capacity of Pulsar isn't enough, which may cause overflow.

- Temperature: 100°C
- Water quality: Distilled water
    - It will be re-mineralized after brewing (i.e., minerals will be directly added into the coffee after brewing is completed<sup class="footnote-sup">[C]</sup>).
    - If there is no suitable mineral concentrate to add after brewing, you can also directly use water with around 30–40GH, 15–20KH<sup class="footnote-sup">[D]</sup>, with equal parts of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>.
    - If you have no clue about water quality, you can also use ordinary drinking water as long as the TDS isn't too high.
- Grind size: Blade gap 150 to 200 µm.
    - Similar to the normal scale for 9bar espresso.
    - I use a Lagom P100 with 98mm SSP Brew burrs, the grind size is about scale 2.0 to 3.0.
    - If the grinder produces a lot of fines, consider using a slightly coarser grind size.
- Target concentration (TDS): 1.35%+
    - African beans can usually reach 1.45%+.

- Target extraction rate: 23.5%+
    - African beans can usually reach 25%+.

  <div class="footnote-content">Many, including myself, believe that minerals don't participate in extraction, so adding them before or after brewing doesn't make a difference. In this case, I chose to add minerals after brewing for convenience. I use <a href="https://lotuscoffeeproducts.com/">Lotus Coffee Brew Water</a> for my mineral concentrate.</div>

##### Necessary Equipment

-   Lightly roasted coffee
    -   Since our goal is an extremely high extraction rate, we need to ensure the coffee is good under a high extraction setting, in my experience, high extraction usually suits coffee roasted lighter.
    -   Some roasters with a higher success rate in my experiments: [SEY](https://www.seycoffee.com/), [Manhattan](https://manhattancoffeeroasters.com/), [Prodigal](https://getprodigal.com/).
-   Pulsar and its specific filter paper
-   Grinder, server, electronic scale and other basic pour-over equipment (you might not even need a pour-over kettle!).
-   WDT tool
    -   Also can use a spoon, chopstick, or glass rod as substitutes that can stir the coffee bed during blooming.

##### Detailed Brewing Steps

1.   Separate the walls and base of the Pulsar.
2.   Close the valve, pour a little hot water into the base, just enough to cover the ribs below.
3.   Place the filter paper, it will float above the water.
4.   Open the valve, the filter paper will neatly adhere to below.
     -   This ensures there are no bubbles between the valve and filter paper, allowing for smoother water flow.
5.   Attach the cup walls to the base, and close the valve.
6.   Weigh 18g of coffee, grind it and pour it into the cup, and level it (WDT tool recommended).
7.   (With the valve closed) Put on the distributor, pour in 100g of water with a large volume, and stir with a WDT tool or stirring stick to ensure all powder absorbs water, steam for 1:00.
     -   If the coffee is very fresh, stirring should be done more cautiously to ensure even stirring, otherwise continuous bubbling in the coffee bed may cause many small pits.
8.   Perform a gentle shaking (a.k.a. Rao Spin) to ensure a flat coffee bed.
9.   (With the valve closed) Begin pouring water slowly (about 2.5g/s) at 1:00 until reaching 360g, the pouring should not finish earlier than 2:30.
10.   Half-open the valve, about the 1 to 2 o’clock direction (or 10 to 11 o'clock), the smaller the better, but the flow should be smooth (not dripping).
11.   Wait until all water has drained, the total brewing time should be about 6–8 minutes.
12.   Use [Lotus Coffee Brew Water](https://lotuscoffeeproducts.com/) to perform re-mineralize, add one drop of CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution and MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution each, two drops of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution, by then Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> will be about 15 ppm as CaCO<sub>3</sub> each.

#### Parameter Design Ideas

Below, I'll introduce some of the unusual aspects within this parameter set and the ideas behind them.

##### Large Volume of Soaking for Blooming

Generally, the water volume for blooming falls between 2.5 to 3.5 times the weight of the coffee, a large volume of blooming might be considered as "wasting water" and often appears in parameters that do not pursuit high extraction rates, like Patrik's April parameter.

However, Pulsar differs crucially from other pour-over cups: it has a "valve", and we bloom with the valve closed, ensuring all water has sufficient contact time with the coffee.

Furthermore, this excessive water serves an extremely important purpose: it ensures the rest of the extraction is "low disturbance". As emphasized in the brewing process, blooming requires stirring with WWDT or rods to ensure all the powder absorbs water. Anyone who has tried cupping or siphon would notice that after thorough stirring, most of the floating grounds start to sink; ideally, by the end of blooming, all grounds should settle evenly at the bottom, and the water above acts as a buffer for subsequent pours, further reducing disturbance.

So, during blooming, make sure the coffee bed is settled and even by its end. If the coffee is too fresh and WWDT or stirring isn't done properly, the coffee bed might continue absorbing water and bubbling during brewing, causing an uneven coffee bed, potentially leading to uneven water flow or channeling when the valve is opened later. In such cases, consider more thorough WWDT or stirring.

##### Single Pour

A single pour is a method common in parameters meant for low extraction rates. It lacks the disturbance of multiple pours, and the high water level (after all, all the water is poured at once) brought by the high flow rate can easily make the total extraction time too short, both usually lead to a decrease in extraction rate.

But don't forget, Pulsar has a "valve"! This means that the flow rate isn't entirely controlled by the height of the water level but also by the size of the valve, so we can ensure enough brewing time by opening the valve smaller.

Choosing a single pour ultimately comes from our intention for "low disturbance"; a single pour ensures there's enough buffer between the coffee bed and the water surface, and our pouring process throughout is rather slow, further reducing disturbance.

##### I know single pour isn't a bad choice, but why not adopt multi-stage pouring?

I admit I might have glossed over some details in the previous section.

Despite the overall process differs significantly, as pointed out in the title, this parameter set shares the same central idea and goal with my previous article, [Achieving High Extraction with Low Disturbance](https://whycoffee.blog/articles/%E4%BB%A5%E4%BD%8E%E6%93%BE%E5%8B%95%E9%81%94%E6%88%90%E9%AB%98%E8%90%83%E5%8F%96%E7%8E%87). To remind everyone, in the previous recipe, we used OREA V3 pour-over cup, and the whole brewing included five pours including the blooming. Then why does this recipe use such an unusual single pour water mode?

Generally, increasing the number of pours results in the following three effects:

1.   Increase in disturbance, raising extraction efficiency.
     -   But this is what we'd like to avoid in this parameter set, hence can be considered a "side effect" of multi-stage pours.
2.   Increase in concentration difference, raising extraction efficiency.
     -   When pouring, we add completely clean water into the cup, causing a larger concentration difference between water and coffee grounds.
3.   Lower average water level (since we pour less water each time), reducing flow rate, increasing total extraction time, and thereby increasing the extraction rate.

In the original OREA parameters, the purpose of multi-stage pouring was mainly for 2. and 3., but it also brings about 1. as a "side effect". As I mentioned in the previous chapter, on Pulsar, I can achieve the goal of increasing total extraction time mentioned in 3. by controlling the size of the valve, leaving only 2. as the advantage of multi-stage pouring. In my tests, the "advantage" of 2. wasn't enough to compensate for the "disadvantage" of 1., hence finally adopting a single pour method.

Lacking concentration difference also forced me to use a finer grind to achieve a similar extraction rate; in the previous article's parameters, I used a grind size of 200 to 300 µm, but in this Pulsar parameter, I use 150 to 200 µm. This might increase the bitterness and astringency for some beans. In such cases, I recommend trying to divide pours and slightly coarsening the grind.

##### So, is this a full immersion recipe?

When I first received this parameter sketch from Lance, my first question was: "Isn't this essentially a full immersion recipe? Then why do we need steaming?" Yes, generally speaking, immersion brewing (or rather "close to" full immersion, since most brewing methods still employ filtering to remove fines at the end) like inverted AeroPress or siphon, doesn't require steaming. But if you think about it carefully, this is not a full immersion recipe, but rather a very slow filtration extraction (or should I say half immersion half filtration, but the filtration part should take a larger portion), why? Because there's no "immersion" process.

Immersion extraction is generally considered a less efficient method since by mid-extraction, it basically becomes "coffee extracting coffee", as opposed to filter extraction's "water extracting coffee". Since the concentration difference is lower, the efficiency is poorer.

However, in this parameter, since we don't stir after blooming is over and the pouring speed is very slow, it can be considered that we gently "stack" the water on top. This keeps the concentration of the upper layer of water not high, and most extraction occurs when water passes through the coffee bed, similar to filter extraction. How to prove this point? By observing the coffee coming out, you'll find that in the early extraction phase, the color of the coffee is very dark, but the last drips become very light. If it were full immersion extraction, the color of the coffee coming out would be similar at any time.

Since most of the extraction occurs during the filtering phase, blooming becomes necessary. And the large volume soaking for blooming we've done, as mentioned earlier, further reduces disturbance.

#### Conclusion

This parameter set, featured in [Achieving High Extraction with Low Disturbance](https://whycoffee.blog/articles/%E4%BB%A5%E4%BD%8E%E6%93%BE%E5%8B%95%E9%81%94%E6%88%90%E9%AB%98%E8%90%83%E5%8F%96%E7%8E%87), shows significant differences from the parameters mentioned previously, but they are based on similar concepts, thus sharing a similar flavor profile, aiming for "clear, complex, sweet" as the overall extraction goal.

In my own trials, this parameter set is somewhat simpler (since you only need to pour once), but the success rate is lower, and some beans, regardless of adjustments, will produce too much bitterness. I haven't yet figured out why and thus warmly welcome everyone to discuss with me after trying it out<sup class="footnote-sup">[E]</sup>! Maybe together we could further refine this method.
