Low agitation and high extraction sound like conflicting concepts. Agitation (which essentially refers to stirring, including the stirring effect of water flow on coffee grounds) can help coffee grounds thoroughly mix with water, increasing extraction and making it more uniform in most cases.

However, agitation can also accelerate fines migration (usually referring to the settling of fines), which makes the filter more prone to clogging. Clogging can exacerbate channeling and bypass, eventually leading to more astringent substances not being properly filtered by the coffee bed. This is why we often associate clogging with bitter and undesirable flavors<sup class="footnote-sup">[B]</sup>.

#### The Challenge of Brewing with High Extraction Rate

I always prefer coffee with a high extraction rate and generally aim for at least 22% extraction when brewing. In my experience, coffee with a high extraction rate has better flavor complexity and sweetness, and its flavors are closer to those found during cupping. Reproducing cupping flavors during pour-over has always been one of my dreams.

But to achieve high extraction, finer grinding or agitation is needed.

When grinding finer, coffee is cut more times, producing more fines, which makes clogging more likely. Agitation, as mentioned above, also tends to cause clogging.

This makes pursuing high extraction brewing often difficult and frustrating, because even when using burrs that produce very few fines (I use the 98mm SSP Brew burrs), clogging can still occur under fine grinding and high agitation settings. In such cases, even if high extraction is achieved, while enjoying the high complexity and sweetness, one often also has to endure a poorer mouthfeel, more specifically: astringency.

#### The Origin of the Low Agitation Method

The issue of astringency has been gaining more attention in the coffee enthusiast community recently. I discussed my problem of excessive astringency during high extraction with many international enthusiasts on Discord, but most people did not pursue such high extraction rates, and grinding coarser became the simplest solution: not only reducing the amount of fines, making clogging less likely, but also reducing the number of times coffee is cut, thus decreasing the amount of astringent substances released from broken cell walls (this is somewhat complex, please refer to [Jonathan Gagné's article](https://coffeeadastra.com/2022/08/01/the-mechanism-behind-astringency-in-coffee/) if interested).

But I wondered, isn't there a way to reduce astringency under high extraction? The one that I know of that is closest to my extraction philosophy of "maximizing extraction rate, reproducing cupping flavors" is probably [SEY](https://www.seycoffee.com/), a coffee shop I like very much located in Brooklyn. Most of the coffee I brew comes from them. Out of curiosity, I sent them an email asking about their brewing parameters, and mentioned my views on astringency.

Actually, I did not expect a reply, because from past contact experiences, it was evident they were overwhelmed just by order messages. However, to my surprise, two days later, I received a detailed reply from them (I guess written by the famous owner Lance?).

Lance (or whoever I thought was Lance) suggested: when trying to increase extraction rate using very fine grounds slightly coarser than for espresso, use a [Melodrip](https://melodrip.co/) (a shower-like device) for brewing to reduce agitation, because in his experience, agitation increased astringency, which I guess might partly be related to the risk of clogging caused by agitation.

The last sentence is the core of this article: **The trick is how to achieve high EY without using agitation**.

#### The Potential Problems Brought by Low Agitation

We can easily think of a few potential problems:
- With extremely fine grinding, the amount of fines will definitely be more than with coarse grinding. Although agitation is reduced, is there still a high risk of clogging?

- With the lack of agitation, the coffee at the bottom of the filter may be under-extracted. If the bottom extraction is insufficient, is it difficult to achieve high extraction rate?

Surprisingly, SEY uses the exact same burrs (the original version of the 98mm SSP Brew) as us, which means this parameter should be directly applicable to us. I modified this parameter using the equipment I had at hand, replacing the V60 with the [Orea V3](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-brewer-v3-mk2) using [negotiated](https://shop.orea.uk/products/negotiator-tool) [Flat filter papers](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-flat-paper-filter-type-g) that have less bypass, and used the disperser that comes with [Pulsar](https://nextlevelbrewer.com/pulsar-brewer/) instead of [Melodrip](https://melodrip.co/).

After some experiments, I can confidently say that both of the above-mentioned problems do not exist, or at least are not serious. The chance of clogging is greatly reduced compared to the parameters I usually use for brewing, and it is easy to achieve an extraction rate of over 24%.

#### Detailed Parameter Introduction

    </div>
</div>

Below are the detailed parameter introductions and brewing steps:

- Coffee to water ratio: 16g:320g (1:20)
- Water temperature: 100°C
- Water quality: pure water
    - Will re-mineralize after brewing (i.e., directly add minerals to the coffee after brewing is completed<sup class="footnote-sup">[C]</sup>).
    - If there is no suitable mineral concentrate to be added after brewing, then you can directly use water around 30–40GH, 15–20KH<sup class="footnote-sup">[D]</sup>, with equal parts Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>.
    - If you have no research on water quality, you can also use normal drinking water with not too high TDS.
    
- Grind size: Burr gap set at 200 to 300 µm.
    - Slightly coarser than the usual espresso setting.
    - I used the Lagom P100 with the 98mm SSP Brew burrs, with grind settings around 3.0 to 4.0.
    - If the grinder produces more fines, consider using a slightly coarser grind size.

- Target concentration (TDS): 1.35%+
- Target extraction rate: 24%+

  <div class="footnote-content">Many, including myself, believe that minerals do not participate in extraction, so adding them before or after brewing does not make a difference.

##### Required Equipment
-   Very lightly roasted coffee
    -   Since our goal is very high extraction rates, it is necessary to ensure that the coffee is good at high extraction settings. In my experience, high extraction usually suits lighter roasted coffee better.
    -   Some experimentally successful roasteries: [SEY](https://www.seycoffee.com/), [Manhattan](https://manhattancoffeeroasters.com/), [Prodigal](https://getprodigal.com/).
-   Filter cup
    -   Any filter cup will do. SEY uses a V60, while I used the [Orea V3](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-brewer-v3-mk2).
    -   To improve extraction rate, try to use a plastic filter cup with better heat retention.
-   Grinder, filter paper, carafe, digital scale, and other basic pour-over equipment (you might not even need a pouring kettle!).
-   Device to reduce agitation
    -   [Melodrip](https://melodrip.co/), [Tricolate](https://tricolate.com/), or the disperser that comes with [Pulsar](https://nextlevelbrewer.com/pulsar-brewer/) will do. Actually, you can also use a small teaspoon to catch the water poured from the kettle, a method shared by [pocketsciencecoffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7EOCcH0v68); as long as it can reduce agitation to the coffee bed, it will work.
-   WDT tool
    -   You can also use a spoon, chopsticks, or glass rod instead, that can stir the coffee bed during the bloom.

    </div>
</div>

The following steps are using [Orea V3](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-brewer-v3-mk2) with [Flat filter papers](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-flat-paper-filter-type-g), [negotiator](https://shop.orea.uk/products/negotiator-tool), and the disperser from [Pulsar](https://nextlevelbrewer.com/pulsar-brewer/) as examples.

1.   Fold a cross pattern on Orea's Flat filter paper, press it into the filter cup using negotiator, and wet the filter paper.
2.   Measure 16g of coffee, grind and dump into the filter cup.
3.   Use the WDT tool to flatten and evenly distribute the coffee in the filter cup.
4.   Start timing, use 40g of water for blooming, **no need to use the disperser at this time**.
5.   Immediately perform Wet WDT with the WDT tool, gentle stirring is enough, too vigorous stirring can lead to clogging risk.
6.   After Wet WDT, perform a gentle shake (Rao Spin) to ensure the coffee bed is flat and without holes poked by the WDT tool.
7.   Place the disperser of Pulsar above the filter cup, the disperser weighs 50g, so the total weight shown on the scale at this time is 90g.
8.   At 1:00, add 70g of water, initially add water in a larger amount to ensure even distribution within the disperser, then pour at a rate of 2.5–3g/s in the center.
9.   Gently shake the filter cup to flatten the coffee bed.
10.   When the water level above the coffee bed is about 0.5–1cm left, add another 70g of water, and repeat steps 8 and 9. Repeat this four times, and the total weight shown on the scale should be 370g, indicating a total water usage of 320g (because the disperser weighs 50g).
11.   Wait for the water to completely drain, the total brewing time should be about 7–9 minutes, but generally, as long as the total time is within 10 minutes, there should not be too much problem with flavor.
12.   Use [Lotus Coffee Brew Water](https://lotuscoffeeproducts.com/) for re-mineralize, add one drop of CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution, one drop of MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution, and two drops of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution to the coffee, resulting in approximately 15 ppm as CaCO<sub>3</sub> for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.

#### Brewing Data and Discussion

    </div>
</div>

From this chart, you can see that the intervals between the four pours after blooming are quite consistent, which means that the flow rate did not decrease too much in the latter part of the extraction, a characteristic that clogging was not severe. I believe an overall brewing time of around 8 minutes is probably longer than most people are familiar with, thus the average flow rate is also slower, but the flow rate remained stable throughout the brewing process, which is a good sign for me.

This parameter is extremely stable, with the highest success rate among the high extraction rate parameters I've used. The very low agitation greatly reduces the chances of clogging, but the very fine grind still supports a very high extraction rate, and the mouthfeel is quite clean, almost transparent. If we consider reproducing the flavors in the cupping bowl as the ultimate goal of brewing, then I think this parameter is currently the most successful.

It is worth mentioning that in brewing step 4, it is mentioned that the disperser is not needed during blooming, which is very important. In our tests, if the disperser is used during blooming, even if subsequent Wet WDT and Rao Spin ensure even mixing of coffee and water, the extraction rate would decrease significantly by about 2%–3%. This phenomenon actually does not quite conform to logic and may require further testing and verification.

#### Conclusion

I believe those accustomed to high extraction rate coffee will be amazed by the cleanliness brought by this parameter, while those accustomed to low extraction rate coffee will be fascinated by the complexity and sweetness brought by high extraction rates. Either way, if you try this parameter, please be sure to tell me how you feel!

Although this parameter requires an additional disperser, I believe using a spoon or similar alternatives should also yield decent results. During brewing, the intervals between the four pours after blooming can be used as an observation indicator. With minimal agitation, the intervals should be quite consistent. If you notice a significant decrease in flow rate in the later stages of brewing, which is the phenomenon of clogging, then you may need to further reduce agitation or grind a bit coarser.

I hope everyone can successfully brew complex and sweet coffee with this parameter! Or if you have any questions, feel free to discuss with me on [IG](https://instagram.com/whycoffee.blog)!
