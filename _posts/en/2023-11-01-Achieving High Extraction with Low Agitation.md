Low agitation and high extraction might seem like opposing concepts. Agitation can ensure coffee grounds mix thoroughly with water, [increasing extraction and making it more uniform](https://www.instagram.com/p/CygUKuNLw94/?img_index=2) in most cases.

However, agitation can also speed up fines migration, leading to a higher likelihood of filter clogging. Clogging can worsen channeling and bypass, ultimately causing more astringent substances to not be properly filtered by the coffee bed. This is why clogging is often associated with astringency and undesirable flavors<sup class="footnote-sup">[B]</sup>.

#### The Challenge of Brewing with a High Extraction Yield

I always aim for at least a 22% extraction yield when brewing my coffee, preferring those with a high extraction yield for their improved flavor complexity and sweetness, closely resembling the flavors found during cupping. Reproducing the flavor profile of cupping with pour-over has always been a dream of mine.

But achieving high extraction requires either finer grinding or more agitation (or both).

Grinding finer results in the coffee being cut more frequently, producing more fines, which can clog the filter. As mentioned, agitation also tends to cause clogging.

Thus, pursuing a high extraction yield often becomes challenging and frustrating because, even with burrs that produce very few fines (like the 98mm SSP Brew burrs I use), clogging can still occur under a fine grind setting and high agitation. In such situations, despite achieving high extraction, the high complexity and sweetness come with the downside of a poor mouthfeel: astringency.

#### The Origin of the Low Agitation Method

The issue of astringency has recently attracted more attention in the coffee enthusiast community. Experiencing excessive astringency during high extraction brews, I discussed the issue with international enthusiasts on Discord. However, most did not aim for such high extraction yields, and grinding coarser emerged as the simplest solution: it not only reduced the amount of fines, making clogging less likely, but also decreased the amount of astringent substances released from broken cell walls. This approach, though effective, felt like a compromise to me (for more on this, see [Jonathan Gagné's article](https://coffeeadastra.com/2022/08/01/the-mechanism-behind-astringency-in-coffee/)).

Seeking a way to reduce astringency while maintaining high extraction led me to [SEY](https://www.seycoffee.com/), a favorite coffee shop of mine located in Brooklyn, which closely aligns with my extraction philosophy of "maximizing extraction rate, reproducing cupping flavors". Much of the coffee I brew comes from them. Out of curiosity, I sent them an email inquiring about their brewing recipe and shared my experiences with astringency.

Actually, I did not expect a reply, because from past contact experiences, it was evident they were overwhelmed just by order messages. Surprisingly, two days later, I received a detailed response (presumably from the famous "SEY Lance"?). Below is the email I received:

> For filter coffee, I have my grinder (Nautilus w/ SSP Brew Burrs) at around 250 and 300 microns. 
> 
> Our water is: Mg - 15ppm, Ca - 20ppm, Bicarbonate (KH) - 15ppm
>
> For the sake of simplicity, we'll talk about V60. As you know, we're really working towards figuring out how to increase EY. With our coffees, you should be able to achieve 24%+ for most Latin coffees and 26%+ for most African coffees. Our brew times are between 6 and 8 minutes for complete draw-down times. looking for a 1.4%—1.5% TDS.
>
> A simple technique to try: 16g dose at a 1:20 ratio. Bloom for 60 seconds with a very gentle stir and swirl for complete saturation. With a Melodrip, do 75g pulses until the desired out weight with gentle swirls between pulses. This should result in somewhere between 6 and 8 minutes of total brew time. If longer, I wouldn't worry unless there are off flavors in the cups.
>
> Something to note is that with really high EYs the coffee really changes and improves as the coffee cools.
>
> To mitigate astringency, I'd recommend trying a Melodrip and using zero agitation. For us, we've noticed that although agitation helps increase EY, it also increases astringency. So, **trying to get high EYs without using agitation is kind of the trick.**

In essence, Lance's advice was to use a [Melodrip](https://melodrip.co/) (a shower-like device) to reduce agitation when aiming for a high extraction yield with a very fine grind, as agitation, in his experience, increased astringency, which might be partly due to clogging.

The last sentence of the email is the key takeaway: **The trick is how to achieve high EY without using agitation**.

#### The Potential Problems Brought by Low Agitation

A few potential issues come to mind:
- With an extremely fine grind, the amount of fines will undoubtedly increase. Even with reduced agitation, is there still a high risk of clogging?

- Without agitation, the coffee at the bottom of the filter may be under-extracted. Could this hinder achieving a high extraction yield?

Surprisingly, SEY uses the exact same burr set (the [98mm SSP Brew V1](https://www.home-barista.com/brewing/ssp-98mm-brewing-burrs-t74971.html)) as us, indicating that this recipe could be directly applicable. I adapted it using my available equipment, substituting the V60 for the [Orea V3](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-brewer-v3-mk2) with [negotiated](https://shop.orea.uk/products/negotiator-tool) [flat filter papers](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-flat-paper-filter-type-g) that have less bypass and used the disperser from [Pulsar](https://nextlevelbrewer.com/pulsar-brewer/) instead of [Melodrip](https://melodrip.co/).

After extensive experiments, I can confidently confirm that the previously mentioned problems were nonexistent or at least not serious. The chance of clogging was much lower compared to the recipes I usually use, and achieving an extraction yield of over 24% was straightforward.

    </div>
</div>

Here are the detailed parameters and brewing steps for this recipe:

- Coffee to water ratio: 16g:320g (1:20)
- Water temperature: 100°C
- Brewing water: distilled water, re-mineralized post-brewing (for convenience, minerals are added directly to the brewed coffee<sup class="footnote-sup">[C]</sup>).
  - Without a specific mineral concentrate, aim for water with 30–40GH, 15–20KH<sup class="footnote-sup">[D]</sup>, balanced between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>.
  - If unsure about water, normal tap water with a low TDS is acceptable.
    
- Grind size: Burr gap set between 200 to 300 µm from lock.
  - Only slightly coarser than typical 9 bar espresso settings.
  - I used the Lagom P100 with the 98mm SSP Brew burrs, with grind settings between 3.0 and 4.0.
  - If your grinder produces more fines, consider a slightly coarser grind.

- Target concentration (TDS): 1.35%+
- Target extraction yield: 24%+

  <div class="footnote-content">Many, including myself, believe minerals don't participate in extraction, so adding them before or after doesn't hugely impact the brew.

##### Required Equipment
-   Very lightly roasted coffee
    -   Since our goal is a very high extraction yield, it is necessary to ensure that the coffee tastes good at high extraction. In my experience, high extraction usually suits lighter roasted coffee better.
    -   Roasteries I normally use with this recipe: [SEY](https://www.seycoffee.com/), [The Picky Chemist](https://en.thepickychemist.com/).
-   Dripper
    -   Any dripper will do. SEY uses a V60, while I used the [Orea V3](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-brewer-v3-mk2).
    -   To increase extraction yield, try to use a plastic filter cup with better heat retention.
-   Grinder, filter paper, carafe, digital scale, and other basic pour-over equipment (you might not even need a pouring kettle!).
-   Device to reduce agitation
    -   [Melodrip](https://melodrip.co/) or the disperser that comes with either [Pulsar](https://nextlevelbrewer.com/pulsar-brewer/) or [Tricolate](https://tricolate.com/) will do. Actually, you can also use a small teaspoon to catch the water poured from the kettle, a method shared by [pocketsciencecoffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7EOCcH0v68); as long as it can reduce agitation to the coffee bed, it will work.
-   A WDT tool
    -   You can also use a spoon, chopsticks, or glass stick instead, something that can stir the coffee bed during the bloom.

##### Detailed Brewing Steps

        <span class="image-span">Equipment setup during brewing (note: the disperser isn't needed during bloom)<br>The backdrop is the NTU Coffee Club's cluttered office</span>
    </div>
</div>

The steps below use the [Orea V3](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-brewer-v3-mk2) with [negotiated](https://shop.orea.uk/products/negotiator-tool) [flat filter papers](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-flat-paper-filter-type-g) and the disperser from [Pulsar](https://nextlevelbrewer.com/pulsar-brewer/) as examples.

1. Fold a cross pattern on Orea's flat filter paper, negotiate it into the dripper using the negotiator, and pre-wet it.
2. Measure 16g of coffee, grind, and transfer to the dripper.
3. Flatten and distribute the coffee evenly with the WDT tool.
4. Begin timing, add 40g of water for blooming. **Do not use the disperser yet**.
5. Stir gently with the WDT tool (Wet WDT) immediately after blooming, avoiding vigorous stirring to minimize clogging risk.
6. After Wet WDT, perform a gentle spin (i.e., Rao Spin) to ensure the coffee bed is flat and without holes poked by the WDT tool.
7. Situate the Pulsar disperser over the dripper. The disperser weighs 50g, so the total weight shown on the scale at this time is 90g.
8. At the 1-minute mark, pour in 70g of water, starting with a larger amount for even distribution, then continue pouring at about 2.5–3g/s in the center.
9.  Level out the coffee bed with a gentle spin.
10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 when roughly 0.5–1cm of water remains above the coffee bed. Repeat this four times, and the total weight shown on the scale should be 370g, indicating a total water usage of 320g (because the disperser weighs 50g).
11. Allow the water to fully drain. The total brew time should be between 7–9 minutes, but as long as it's under 10 minutes, flavor should not be adversely affected.
12. Finish by re-mineralizing with [Lotus Coffee Brew Water](https://lotuscoffeeproducts.com/), adding one drop each of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> solutions, and two drops of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, achieving roughly 15 ppm as CaCO<sub>3</sub> for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.

    </div>
</div>

From the chart, you can see that the intervals between the four pours after blooming are quite consistent, indicating minimal reduction in flow rate and limited clogging. An 8-minute brew time might be longer than what many are used to, and the average flow rate is also slow, but the flow rate remained consistent throughout the brewing process, which is a good sign for me.

This parameter offers a stable, high success rate among high extraction yield recipes I've tried. Low agitation significantly reduces clogging risks, while a very fine grind setting enables a high extraction yield. The result is a clean, almost transparent mouthfeel. If reproducing cupping flavors is the ultimate brewing goal, this recipe might currently be the most successful.

It's worth noting that the disperser is not used during blooming, an important detail. Our tests showed that using the disperser during blooming, even when followed by thorough mixing by performing Wet WDT and Rao Spin, reduced the extraction rate by about 2%–3%, a curious phenomenon warranting further investigation.

#### Conclusion

I believe those accustomed to high extraction yield coffees will appreciate the cleanliness this recipe brings, while fans of lower yields will enjoy its complexity and sweetness. Either way, if you try this recipe, please be sure to tell me how you feel!

Although this recipe requires an additional disperser, effective alternatives like a spoon could also yield good results. During brewing, the intervals between pours after blooming serve as a consistency indicator. With minimal agitation and no clogging, the intervals should remain fairly consistent. Encountering a significant reduction in flow rate indicates potential clogging, suggesting the need for either less agitation or a coarser grind.

I hope everyone can successfully brew coffee that is complex, sweet, and transparent with this recipe! If you have any questions or want to share your experiences, feel free to connect with me on [IG](https://instagram.com/whycoffee.blog)!
