Low agitation and high extraction may seem like contradictory concepts. Agitation helps coffee grounds mix thoroughly with water, and in most cases, it [increases extraction and makes extraction more even](https://www.instagram.com/p/CygUKuNLw94/?img_index=2).

However, agitation also accelerates fines migration (usually referring to the settling of fines), making the filter more prone to clogging. Clogging can exacerbate channeling and bypass, ultimately leading to more astringent substances not being properly filtered by the coffee bed. This is why we usually associate clogging with astringency and undesirable flavors<sup class="footnote-sup">[B]</sup>.

#### The Challenges of High Extraction Brews

I have always enjoyed high extraction coffee and generally aim for at least 22% extraction yield when brewing. In my experience, high extraction coffee has better flavor complexity and sweetness, and is closer to the flavors in cupping. Reproducing the flavors from the cupping bowl in pour-over has always been one of my dreams.

However, achieving high extraction requires either finer grinding or more agitation (or both).

When grinding finer, the coffee is cut more times, and more fines are produced due to fracturing, making clogging more likely to occur. Agitation, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, also easily leads to clogging.

This makes the pursuit of high extraction brewing often difficult and frustrating because even when using burrs that produce very few fines (I use the 98mm SSP Brew burrs), clogging cannot be completely avoided with fine grinding and high agitation settings. In this situation, even if high extraction is achieved, while enjoying the high flavor complexity and sweetness, one often has to endure a rather poor mouthfeel, more precisely: astringency.

#### The Origin of the Low Agitation Method Idea

The issue of astringency has been receiving increasing attention in the coffee enthusiast community recently. I also discussed my problem of overly obvious astringency at high extraction with many overseas enthusiasts on Discord, but most people don't pursue such high extraction yields, so grinding coarser became the simplest solution: not only does it reduce the amount of fines, making clogging less likely to occur, it also reduces the number of times the coffee is cut, which reduces the astringent substances released due to cell wall damage that are difficult to dissolve in water (this is more complex; if interested, please also refer to [Jonathan Gagné's article](https://coffeeadastra.com/2022/08/01/the-mechanism-behind-astringency-in-coffee/)).

But I wondered if there really was no way to reduce astringency while maintaining high extraction. In the world, the one I know whose extraction philosophy of "maximizing extraction yield, reproducing cupping flavors" is closest to mine is probably [SEY](https://www.seycoffee.com/). They are a coffee shop I really like located in Brooklyn. Most of the coffee I brew on a daily basis comes from them. Out of curiosity, I emailed them asking about their brewing recipe and mentioned my views on astringency.

I actually didn't expect a reply, because from past contact experiences, it was evident they were overwhelmed just by order messages. To my surprise, two days later I received a detailed reply from them (presumably from the famous "SEY Lance"?). The content was as follows:

> For filter coffee, I have my grinder (Nautilus w/ SSP Brew Burrs) at around 250 and 300 microns. 
> 
> Our water is: Mg - 15ppm, Ca - 20ppm, Bicarbonate (KH) - 15ppm
>
> For the sake of simplicity, we'll talk about V60. As you know, we're really working towards figuring out how to increase EY. With our coffees, you should be able to achieve 24%+ for most Latin coffees and 26%+ for most African coffees. Our brew times are between 6 and 8 minutes for complete draw-down times. looking for a 1.4%—1.5% TDS.
>
> A simple technique to try: 16g dose at a 1:20 ratio. Bloom for 60 seconds with a very gentle stir and swirl for complete saturation. With a Melodrip, do 75g pulses until the desired out weight with gentle swirls between pulses. This should result in somewhere between 6 and 8 minutes of total brew time. If longer, I wouldn't worry unless there are off flavors in the cups.
>
> Something to note is that with really high EYs the coffee really changes and improves as the coffee cools.
>
> To mitigate astringency, I'd recommend trying a Melodrip and using zero agitation. For us, we've noticed that although agitation helps increase EY, it also increases astringency. So, **trying to get high EYs without using agitation is kind of the trick.**

The solution Lance (or the person I thought was Lance) proposed was: when using extremely fine grounds only slightly coarser than espresso to increase extraction yield, use a [Melodrip](https://melodrip.co/) (a shower head-like device) for brewing to reduce agitation, because in his experience, agitation increases astringency. I guess this may be partly related to the clogging risk brought by agitation.

The last sentence is the main theme of this article: **the key is how to use a low agitation method to achieve high extraction yield**.

#### Potential Problems with Low Agitation

We can also easily think of a few potential problems:
-   When grinding extremely fine, the amount of fines is definitely more than when grinding coarse. Even if agitation is reduced, is there still a high risk of clogging?

- When lacking agitation, the coffee at the bottom of the dripper is easily under-extracted. If the bottom of the dripper is under-extracted, is it difficult to achieve a high extraction yield?

Surprisingly, SEY uses the exact same burr set as us ([the 98mm SSP Brew V1](https://www.home-barista.com/brewing/ssp-98mm-brewing-burrs-t74971.html)), indicating that this recipe could be directly applicable. I modified this recipe with the equipment I had on hand, using the less bypass [Orea V3](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-brewer-v3-mk2) with [negotiated](https://shop.orea.uk/products/negotiator-tool) [flat filters](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-flat-paper-filter-type-g) instead of the V60, and using the dispersion screen that comes with the [Pulsar](https://nextlevelbrewer.com/pulsar-brewer/) instead of the [Melodrip](https://melodrip.co/).

After extensive experiments, I can confidently say that both of the above problems are non-existent, or at least not serious. The probability of clogging is greatly reduced compared to my usual brewing recipes, and it is easy to achieve an extraction yield of over 24%.

    </div>
</div>

Below are the detailed parameters and brewing steps:

- Coffee to water ratio: 16g:320g (1:20)
- Water temperature: 100°C
- Brewing water: distilled water, re-mineralized post-brew (minerals are added directly to the brewed coffee<sup class="footnote-sup">[C]</sup>).
    - Aim for water with 30–40GH, 15–20KH<sup class="footnote-sup">[D]</sup>, which equal amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>.
    - If unsure about water, normal tap water with a low TDS is acceptable.
    
- Grind size: Burr gap set between 200 to 300 µm from lock.
    - Only slightly coarser than typical 9 bar espresso settings.
    - I used the Lagom P100 with the 98mm SSP Brew burrs, with grind settings between 3.0 and 4.0.
    - If your grinder produces more fines, consider a slightly coarser grind.

- Target concentration (TDS): 1.35%+
- Target extraction yield: 24%+

##### Required Equipment
-   Very lightly roasted coffee
    -   Since our goal is a very high extraction yield, it is necessary to ensure that the coffee tastes good at high extraction. In my experience, high extraction usually suits lighter roasted coffee better.
    -   Roasteries I've experimented with and had higher success rates: [SEY](https://www.seycoffee.com/), [The Picky Chemist](https://en.thepickychemist.com/).
-   Dripper
    -   Any dripper works. SEY uses the V60, while I use the [Orea V3](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-brewer-v3-mk2).
    -   To increase extraction yield, use a plastic dripper with better heat retention if possible.
-   Grinder, filter papers, carafe, digital scale, and other basic pour-over equipment (you might not even need a pouring kettle!).
-   Device to reduce agitation
    -   [Melodrip](https://melodrip.co/), [Tricolate](https://tricolate.com/), or the dispersion screen that comes with the [Pulsar](https://nextlevelbrewer.com/pulsar-brewer/) all work. You can also use a small spoon to catch the water poured from the kettle. The method can be found in [this technique shared by pocketsciencecoffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7EOCcH0v68). As long as it can reduce agitation to the coffee bed, it works.
-   A WDT tool
    -   You can also use a spoon, chopsticks, or glass stick instead, something that can stir the coffee bed during the bloom.

##### Detailed Brewing Steps

        <span class="image-span">Equipment setup during brewing (note: the disperser isn't needed during bloom)<br>The background is the messy NTU Coffee Club clubroom</span>
    </div>
</div>

The following steps use the [Orea V3](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-brewer-v3-mk2) with [negotiated](https://shop.orea.uk/products/negotiator-tool) [flat filters](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-flat-paper-filter-type-g) and the dispersion screen from the [Pulsar](https://nextlevelbrewer.com/pulsar-brewer/) as an example.

1.   Fold creases in the Orea's flat filter in a cross pattern, press it into the dripper with the negotiator, and rinse the filter.
2.   Measure 16g of coffee, grind, and pour into the dripper.
3.   Use a WDT tool to make the coffee bed flat and evenly distributed in the dripper.
4.   Start the timer, use 40g of water for the bloom, **the dispersion screen is not needed at this time**.
5.   Immediately perform a Wet WDT with the WDT tool, gently is fine, being too vigorous risks causing clogging.
6.   Immediately after the Wet WDT, perform a gentle spin (i.e., do a Rao Spin) to ensure the coffee bed is flat and has no small holes poked by the WDT tool.
7.   Place the Pulsar's dispersion screen on top of the dripper. The dispersion screen weighs 50g, so the total weight shown on the scale at this time is 90g.
8.   At 1:00, pour in 70g of water. Start with a slightly larger amount of water so it can be evenly distributed in the dispersion screen, then pour in the center at a rate of 2.5–3g/s.
9.   Gently spin the dripper to make the coffee bed flat.
10.   When the water level above the coffee bed is about 0.5–1cm, pour in another 70g of water and repeat 8. and 9. After repeating four times, the total weight shown on the scale should be 370g, meaning the total amount of water used is 320g (because the dispersion screen weighs 50g).
11.   Wait for the water to completely drain. The total brew time is about 7–9 minutes, but usually as long as the total time is within 10 minutes, there won't be too much of a problem with the flavor.
12.   Use [Lotus Coffee Brew Water](https://lotuscoffeeproducts.com/) to re-mineralize. Add one drop each of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> solutions, and two drops of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> to the brewed coffee. At this point, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> are all approximately 15 ppm as CaCO<sub>3</sub>.

</div>

From this graph, we can see that the time intervals between the four pours after the bloom are similar, which means the flow rate did not decrease too much in the later stages of extraction. This is a characteristic of clogging not being severe. I believe an 8-minute total brew time is definitely longer than most people are familiar with, so the average flow rate is also slower, but the flow rate is stable throughout the entire brewing process, which to me is a good sign.

This recipe is extremely stable and has the highest success rate among the high extraction recipes I use. The extremely low agitation greatly reduces the probability of clogging, but the extremely fine grind can still support a very high extraction yield, and the mouthfeel is very clean, almost with a sense of transparency. If we consider reproducing the flavors in the cupping bowl as the ultimate goal of brewing, then I think this recipe is the most successful so far.

It's worth mentioning that in brewing step 4, the dispersion screen is not needed during the bloom. This point is very important. In our tests, if the dispersion screen is used during the bloom, even if the Wet WDT and Rao Spin are used to ensure the coffee and water mix evenly, the extraction yield will still decrease by about 2%–3%. This phenomenon is actually not very explainable and may require further testing and verification.

#### Conclusion

I believe people who are used to drinking high extraction coffee will be amazed by the cleanliness brought by this recipe, while people who are used to drinking low extraction coffee will be fascinated by the complexity and sweetness brought by high extraction. Either way, if you try this recipe, please be sure to tell me your thoughts!

Although this recipe requires an additional dispersion screen, I believe using alternatives like spoons should also yield pretty good results. When brewing, you can use the time intervals between the four pours after the bloom as an observation indicator. When agitation is low, the time intervals should be similar. If you find the flow rate decreasing significantly in the later stages of brewing, i.e., clogging, you may need to further reduce agitation or grind a little coarser.

I hope everyone can successfully brew coffee that is complex, sweet, and transparent with this recipe! If you have any questions or want to share your experiences, feel free to connect with me via [IG](https://instagram.com/whycoffee.blog)!
