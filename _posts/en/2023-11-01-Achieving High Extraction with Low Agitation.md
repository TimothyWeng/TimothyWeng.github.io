Low agitation and high extraction seem to be conflicting concepts. Agitation can help the coffee grounds mix thoroughly with water, [increasing extraction and making it more even in most cases](https://www.instagram.com/p/CygUKuNLw94/?img_index=2).

However, agitation also accelerates fines migration (usually referring to the settling of fines), making the paper filter more prone to clogging. Clogging can exacerbate channeling and bypass, ultimately leading to more bitter substances not being properly filtered by the coffee bed. This is why we usually associate clogging with unpleasant flavors like bitterness<sup class="footnote-sup">[B]</sup>.

#### The Challenges of High-Extraction Brews

I have always enjoyed high-extraction coffee, and usually aim for at least 22% extraction when brewing. In my experience, high-extraction coffee has better flavor complexity, more sweetness, and tastes closer to cupping. Being able to recreate flavors in cupping bowls with pour-over has long been one of my dreams.

But to achieve high extraction rates, either a finer grind setting or the help of agitation is needed.

When grinding finer, the coffee is cut more times, producing more fines from the fracturing, which makes clogging more likely. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, agitation also tends to lead to clogging.

Pursuing high-extraction brews can often be challenging and frustrating. Even when using burrs that produce very few fines, such as the 98mm SSP Brew burrs that I use, clogging remains a problem when grinding finely and using high agitation. This is because the combination of fine grind size and excessive agitation increases the likelihood of fines migrating and blocking the flow of water through the coffee bed.

As a result, even if a high extraction yield is achieved, it often comes at the cost of a less pleasant mouthfeel, more specifically, astringent. This astringency can detract from the overall experience, despite the heightened flavor complexity and sweetness that high extractions can offer.

#### The Inspiration for Low-Agitation Methods

The issue of astringency has been getting more attention in the coffee enthusiast community lately. I've also discussed my problem of overly apparent astringency at high extractions with many international enthusiasts on Discord. But most people don't pursue such a high extraction yield, so grinding coarser has become the simplest solution. It not only reduces the amount of fines, making clogging less likely, but also reduces the number of times the coffee is cut. This in turn reduces the astringent substances released from broken cell walls that are difficult to dissolve in water (this is more complex; again, refer to [Jonathan Gagné's article](https://coffeeadastra.com/2022/08/01/the-mechanism-behind-astringency-in-coffee/) if interested).

But I wondered, is there really no way to reduce astringency while maintaining high extraction? The place I know of in the world whose extraction philosophy of "maximizing extraction and recreating flavors in cupping bowls" is closest to mine is probably [SEY](https://www.seycoffee.com/). They are my favorite and most-brewed roaster which is located in Brooklyn. Out of curiosity, I emailed them to ask about their brewing parameters and mentioned my experience with astringency.

I didn't expect a reply, because past contact experience showed they barely had time to respond to order messages. To my surprise, two days later I received a detailed reply from them (I guess written by the renowned owner Lance?), which said:

> For filter coffee, I have my grinder (Nautilus w/ SSP Brew Burrs) at around 250 and 300 microns. 
> 
> Our water is: Mg - 15ppm, Ca - 20ppm, Bicarbonate (KH) - 15ppm
>
> For the sake of simplicity, we'll talk about V60. As you know, we're really working towards figuring out how to increase EY. With our coffees, you should be able to achieve 24%+ for most Latin coffees and 26%+ for most African coffees. Our brew times are between 6 and 8 minutes for complete draw-down times. looking for a 1.4%—1.5% TDS.
>
> A simple technique to try: 16g dose at a 1:20 ratio. Bloom for 60 seconds with a very gentle stir and swirl for complete saturation. With a Melodrip, do 75g pulses until the desired out weight with gentle swirls between pulses. This should result in somewhere between 6 and 8 minutes of total brew time. If longer, I wouldn't worry unless there are off flavors in the cups.
>
>Something to note is that with really high EYs the coffee really changes and improves as the coffee cools.
>
>To mitigate astringency, I'd recommend trying a Melodrip and using zero agitation. For us, we've noticed that although agitation helps increase EY, it also increases astringency. So, **trying to get high EYs without using agitation is kind of the trick.**

Lance (or the person I thought was Lance) proposed this solution: When using an extra-fine grind only slightly coarser than espresso to increase extraction, use a [Melodrip](https://melodrip.co/) (a shower head-like device) for brewing to reduce agitation because in his experience agitation increases astringency. I'm guessing this may be partially related to the clogging risk posed by agitation.

The last sentence is the focus of this article: **The key is how to achieve high extraction rates using low-agitation methods.**

#### Potential Issues with Low Agitation

We can also easily think of a few potential issues:

- When grinding extra-fine, the amount of fines is certainly greater than when grinding coarse. Even with reduced agitation, is there still a high risk of clogging?
- With a lack of agitation, the coffee at the bottom of the dripper can easily be under-extracted. If the bottom is under-extracted, is it very difficult to achieve high overall extraction?

Surprisingly, SEY uses the exact same burr set as us (the [98mm SSP Brew V1](https://www.home-barista.com/brewing/ssp-98mm-brewing-burrs-t74971.html)), meaning we should be able to use this recipe directly. I modified the recipe using the equipment I had on hand, replacing the V60 with an [Orea V3](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-brewer-v3-mk2) that has less bypass when paired with [negotiated](https://shop.orea.uk/products/negotiator-tool) [flat filters](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-flat-paper-filter-type-g), and using the dispersion screen that comes with the [Pulsar](https://nextlevelbrewer.com/pulsar-brewer/) instead of the [Melodrip](https://melodrip.co/).

After some experimentation, I can confidently say that both of the above issues are non-existent, or at least not serious. The chance of clogging is greatly reduced compared to my usual brewing parameters, and it's easy to achieve extraction rates over 24%.

    </div>
</div>

Below are the detailed parameters and brewing steps:

-   Brew ratio: 16g:320g (1:20)
-   Water temperature: 100°C
-   Water: Distilled water
    -   Re-mineralization will be performed after brewing (i.e., minerals will be added directly to the coffee after brewing is complete<sup class="footnote-sup">[C]</sup>).
    -   If you don't have a mineral concentrate suitable for adding after brewing, you can also directly use water with around 30–40GH, 15–20KH<sup class="footnote-sup">[D]</sup>, with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> each making up half.
    -   If you have little knowledge of water, you can also just use regular drinking water with reasonably low TDS.
-   Grind size: Burr gap between 200 and 300 µm from lock.
    -   Only slightly coarser than a normal 9-bar espresso setting.
    -   I use the Lagom P100 with 98mm SSP Brew burrs, and the grind size is around 3.0 to 4.0 on the dial.
    -   If your grinder produces more fines, consider using a slightly coarser grind.
-   Target TDS: 1.35%+
-   Target extraction: 24%+

##### Required Equipment

-   Very lightly roasted coffee
    -   Since our goal is an extremely high extraction rate, we need to ensure the coffee tastes good at high extractions in the first place. In my experience, high extraction is usually more suitable for more lightly roasted coffees.
    -   Some roasters I've experimented with that have a higher success rate: [SEY](https://www.seycoffee.com/), [The Picky Chemist](https://en.thepickychemist.com/).
-   Dripper
    -   Any dripper works. SEY uses a V60, while I use an [Orea V3](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-brewer-v3-mk2).
    -   To increase extraction, use a plastic dripper with better heat retention if possible.
-   Basic pour-over equipment like a grinder, filters, serving vessel, and scale (you don't even necessarily need a gooseneck kettle!).
-   A dispersion screen that can reduce agitation
    -   [Melodrip](https://melodrip.co/), or the dispersion screen that comes with the [Pulsar](https://nextlevelbrewer.com/pulsar-brewer/) or [Tricolate](https://tricolate.com/) all work. You can also use a small spoon to catch the water poured from the gooseneck kettle, as demonstrated by @pocketsciencecoffee in their [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7EOCcH0v68). Any method that effectively reduces agitation to the coffee bed can be used as an alternative.
-   WDT tool
    -   A spoon, chopstick, glass stir stick, or other tool that can stir the coffee bed during the bloom can also be used as a substitute.

    </div>
</div>

The following steps use an [Orea V3](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-brewer-v3-mk2) with [negotiated](https://shop.orea.uk/products/negotiator-tool) [flat filters](https://shop.orea.uk/products/orea-flat-paper-filter-type-g) and the dispersion screen from the [Pulsar](https://nextlevelbrewer.com/pulsar-brewer/) as an example.

1.  Fold creases in a cross pattern on the Orea Flat Filter, use the negotiator to press it into the dripper, then rinse the filter.
2.  Weigh out 16g of coffee, grind it, and pour it into the dripper.
3.  Use a WDT tool to flatten the coffee bed and distribute it evenly in the dripper.
4.  Start the timer and use 40g of water for the bloom. **The dispersion screen is not needed at this point**.
5.  Immediately perform a Wet WDT using the WDT tool. Gentle stirring is fine; overly vigorous stirring risks causing clogging.
6.  After finishing the Wet WDT, immediately give a slight swirl (i.e. do a Rao Spin) to ensure the coffee bed is flat with no small holes poked by the WDT tool.
7.  Place the Pulsar dispersion screen above the dripper. The dispersion screen weighs 50g, so the total weight on the scale at this point should be 90g.
8.  At 1:00, pour in 70g of water. Start with a slightly larger amount of water so it can distribute evenly in the dispersion screen, then pour in the center at a rate of 2.5-3g/s.
9.  Gently swirl the dripper to flatten the coffee bed.
10.  When the water level above the coffee bed is around 0.5-1cm, pour in another 70g of water and repeat steps 8 and 9. After repeating four times, the total weight on the scale should be 370g, meaning the total amount of water used is 320g (since the dispersion screen weighs 50g).
11.  Wait for the water to completely drain through. The total brew time should be around 7-9 minutes, but as long as the total time is under 10 minutes, there usually won't be major flavor issues.
12.  Use [Lotus Coffee Brew Water](https://lotuscoffeeproducts.com/) to re-mineralize. Add one drop each of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> solutions, and two drops of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution to the coffee. At this point, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> should each be around 15 ppm as CaCO<sub>3</sub>.

From this chart, we can see that the time intervals between the four pours after the bloom are roughly the same, meaning the flow rate did not decrease too much in the later stages of extraction. This indicates that there's little or no clogging. I believe an 8-minute total brew time is certainly longer than most people are used to, so the average flow rate is also slower. However, the flow rate was stable throughout the entire brewing process, which to me is a good sign.

This recipe is extremely stable and has the highest success rate among the high-extraction recipes I use. The very low agitation greatly reduces the chance of clogging, but the ultra-fine grind can still support an extremely high extraction yield, and the mouthfeel is very clean, almost with a sense of transparency. If we consider recreating the flavors in the cupping bowl to be the ultimate goal of brewing, then I feel this recipe is the most successful so far.

It's worth mentioning that, as noted in step 4 of the brewing steps, the dispersion screen is not needed during the bloom. This is very important. In our tests, if the dispersion screen is used during the bloom, even if a Wet WDT and Rao Spin are subsequently used to ensure the coffee and water mix evenly, the extraction rate will still drop significantly by about 2%-3%. This phenomenon is not entirely understandable and may require further testing and verification.

#### Conclusion

I believe people used to drinking high-extraction coffee will be amazed by the cleanliness this recipe brings, while those used to drinking low-extraction coffee will be fascinated by the complexity and sweetness that high extraction provides. Either way, if you try this recipe, please be sure to tell me your thoughts!

Although this recipe requires an additional dispersion screen, I believe using substitutes like a spoon should also yield decent results. When brewing, you can use the time intervals between the four pours after the bloom as an observation indicator. With low agitation, the time intervals should be roughly the same. If you find the flow rate dropping significantly in the later stages of brewing, i.e. the phenomenon of clogging, you may need to further reduce agitation or grind a bit coarser.

I hope everyone can successfully use this recipe to brew complex and sweet coffee! If you have any questions, feel free to discuss them with me via [IG](https://instagram.com/whycoffee.blog)!
