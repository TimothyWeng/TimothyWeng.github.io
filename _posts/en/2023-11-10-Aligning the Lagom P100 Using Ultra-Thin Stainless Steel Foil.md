This article will cover how to use the marker test and stainless steel foil to align flat burr grinders. I've also documented in detail my process of aligning the 98mm SSP Brew burrs in the NTU Coffee Club's Lagom P100. If you happen to own this grinder, I believe the alignment process will be very helpful for you, but even if your grinder is different, this article should still serve as a great reference.

#### The Importance of Alignment

When grinding with flat burrs, coffee beans fall through the center hole of the burrs, fly outwards due to inertia while being ground by the burrs, and exit the burrs as coffee grounds once their particle size is smaller than the gap between the burrs.

Therefore, the parallelism between the burrs is crucial. If the burrs are not aligned, the gap between them will not be consistent, resulting in slightly different particle sizes on each side, reducing grind uniformity, as illustrated below.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">

In the bottom right image, the burrs are not parallel: the gap on the right is larger, while the gap on the left is smaller, resulting in larger coffee particles on the right side. This leads to non-uniform grinding.

#### Chirp to Lock Distance

So how can we objectively describe the alignment of the burrs? A common indicator is the chirp to lock distance, which is the distance between the chirp point and the lock point of the burrs.

##### Chirp Point

The chirp point is usually where the zero point is set on most grinders. With the grinder running, slowly adjust finer until the burrs touch and make a sharp sound (also known as chirping). The setting at this point is the chirp point.

The burrs are usually very hard, so doing this will not damage them, but be careful not to continue adjusting finer, as the motor may be damaged if the burrs are locked.

##### Lock Point

After finding the chirp point, we can **turn off the grinder (be sure to turn it off!)**. You will then find that you can still adjust finer, and the distance you can adjust until it completely locks up is called the chirp to lock distance. The setting where it completely locks up is the lock point of the grinder.

For example, before I completed the alignment, the setting on my P100 was -0.8 when the adjustment dial could no longer be turned finer, meaning the lock point was -0.8. The chirp point was 0, so the chirp to lock distance was 0.8. I know that on the P100, 1 mark represents a burr gap of 75 µm, so the chirp to lock distance was about 60 µm.

Basically, when the burr size and geometry are the same (e.g., both are 98mm SSP Brew burrs), a smaller chirp to lock distance indicates better burr alignment. This should be quite intuitive, as a smaller chirp to lock distance means the burrs do not touch each other even when very close together, indicating better parallelism.

#### How to Perform the Marker Test and Use Shims for Alignment

A common method for checking burr alignment is the marker test, which, as the name suggests, uses a marker to check alignment.

First, let's clarify one thing. Although we keep mentioning the concept of parallelism, the two burrs need to be not only parallel to each other but also perpendicular to the rotation axis. This is because only one of the two burrs is fixed in position, while the other rotates. So if the burrs are not perpendicular to the rotation axis, even if they are parallel at a certain relative angle, they will still be non-parallel once the burrs start rotating.

Therefore, the marker test is not just about checking if the burrs are parallel but also about checking if the burrs are perpendicular to the rotation axis. The method is simple: apply marker ink to the flat edge of one burr (the one being aligned), reinstall it in the grinder, and start looking for the chirp point. After finding the chirp point and letting the burrs rub slightly, remove the burr. If this burr is perpendicular to the rotation axis, the marker should be wiped off all around the circumference, which we call a full wipe. Conversely, if the marker is only wiped off in one spot, that spot is the first point of contact when adjusting finer, i.e., the highest point of the burr. Usually, we consider the midpoint of the wiped area to be the high point of the burr.

We want to shim the lower side of the burr, so we just need to place shims under the screw opposite the high point to make the burr more parallel. Repeat this process until a full wipe is achieved, indicating that this burr is perpendicular to the rotation axis. Then, align the other burr using the same method to ensure parallelism.

For example:

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-1.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">Burr right after the marker test</span>
    </div>
</div>

Upon closer inspection, you can see that the marker has been wiped off from about 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock, so the high point is at 6 o'clock. This means we need to add shims at the 12 o'clock position. Since there is no screw exactly at 12 o'clock, we usually start with the screw closest to 12 o'clock (i.e., the top left screw).

It's important to note that shims can only be placed under the screws (usually one shim of equal thickness on each side of the screw), because if shims are placed between two screws, the burr may bend: the screws on both sides will apply downward force on the burr, and the shims in the middle will form a fulcrum, causing the burr to bend.

The logic behind this method is quite simple: keep adding shims to the lower areas until the burr is aligned. But if you think about it carefully, you'll realize that this is a very time-consuming and laborious task, as it requires countless disassemblies and reassemblies of the grinder (but... there's no way around it...).

Using only text, it's definitely not possible to explain the process very clearly, so I highly recommend watching this classic [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb3PgeQ6ewY) before actually attempting it.

#### Why Use Stainless Steel Shim?

Shims are usually 0.5 cm * 1 cm in size and are typically made by cutting aluminum foil, as it is one of the easiest materials to find that is both thin and has a consistent thickness. However, I found that using aluminum foil introduces a considerable degree of uncertainty in the alignment process. Even after achieving a full wipe, the aligned state does not last very long. After a few months, the previously higher parts return to being higher, as if the aluminum foil shims placed under the lower parts have been compressed.

I'm not sure if this is physically reasonable, but many people have observed the instability of aluminum foil. The well-known coffee blogger Rohan also urged people to use stainless steel foil instead of aluminum foil in his [article](https://pocketsciencecoffee.com/2023/03/23/superjolly-bearing-replacement-part-2-alignment/)<sup class="footnote-sup">[C]</sup>. Additionally, I found that I could buy stainless steel foil that was even thinner than aluminum foil. So I decided to remove the aluminum foil I had previously used and realign using stainless steel foil, which is why this article was born.

  <div class="footnote-content">Original text: "That's when I vaguely remembered Nate Walck (also coincidentally the previous owner of Frankenjolly) mention on Hedrickcord (Lance Hedrick's discord) that one should consider using stainless steel shims for alignment as opposed to aluminium foil (Long Vo probably was the first to suggest this as a solution on EAF but in context of a different discussion)."</div>

#### Detailed Alignment Process

The following is the process of aligning the 98mm SSP Brew burrs in the Lagom P100, but I believe most of the steps are still valuable as a reference even if your grinder is different.<sup class="footnote-sup">[D]</sup>

I want to emphasize again: the two burrs need to be aligned separately. The burr with the marker applied is the one being aligned. To achieve better alignment, both burrs need to achieve a full wipe. Separate alignment is necessary because both burrs need to be perpendicular to the rotation axis.

</div>

##### Required Materials

-   Marker
-   Torque screwdriver (I used the [Wera 7441 torque screwdriver](https://24h.pchome.com.tw/prod/DEACFQ-A900A9GRS))
    -   A torque screwdriver ensures that the same torque is used each time the burrs are disassembled and reassembled, making the alignment process more consistent, but it's not a necessity. A regular screwdriver can also be used.
    -   As for the choice of torque, I used the 2.5N⋅m recommended by OPTION-O for alignment. This torque is only suitable for 98mm burrs. If your burrs are smaller, I recommend using 2N⋅m.
-   Screwdriver bit
    -   Please choose a screwdriver bit suitable for your grinder. The P100 and most 98mm grinders use PH3 screws.
-   Stainless steel foil
    -   The thinner the foil, the more perfect the alignment can be, but it will also be more time-consuming.
    -   I used extremely thin 5 µm stainless steel foil, which is more expensive than the 10 µm counterpart.

##### How to Remove the Upper Burr of the P100 (skip this section if not using the P100)

Fortunately, the lower burr was already showing a full wipe before alignment, so I didn't need to remove it. But I immediately ran into difficulty when trying to remove the upper burr. After unscrewing the screws, the burr was stuck very tightly and could not be pulled out.

After contacting customer service, they indicated that this was because coffee fines and oils created a near-vacuum state under the burr, causing the burr to be unable to be pulled out due to air pressure. In this case, a softer object (I used the soft-padded handle of a screwdriver) needs to be used to tap the back of the burr. The vibration can effectively break the vacuum, making the burr easier to remove.

        <span class="image-span">Response from the official technician (Hi Sam!)</span>
    </div>
</div>

This problem troubled me for a very long time, so I'm recording it here for reference by other P100 users who encounter the same issue.

##### Begin the Marker Test and Insert Stainless Steel Foil

Now we can officially begin the marker test. I recorded the results of each marker test and under which screws I added shims. These photos have all been aligned and had their backgrounds removed in Photoshop for easy comparison.

Before starting the alignment, it's important to remember the relative position of the burr and the burr carrier. In other words, make sure the burr hasn't been rotated each time it's locked in place, because the burr itself also has tolerances, so arbitrarily changing the relative position will cause the alignment to vary.

This is the state before alignment, with a chirp to lock distance of about 60 µm.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-1.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">Fig. 1<br>(no stainless steel foil inserted yet)</span>
    </div>
</div>

- Area where marker is wiped off: approximately 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock.
- Middle of the high area: 6 o'clock.

It can be seen that the upper half is lower and needs shims added at the 12 o'clock position, but there is no screw there. So I chose to start by placing stainless steel foil under the screw closest to the low point (the top left screw) and observe the changes in the marker test.

After inserting 7 pieces of stainless steel foil under the top left screw, the marker test shows the following.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-3.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">Fig. 2<br>(7, 0, and 0 pieces of stainless steel foil inserted under the top left, bottom left, and right screws respectively)</span>
    </div>
</div>

- Area where marker is wiped off: approximately 3 o'clock to 11 o'clock.
- Middle of the high area: 7 o'clock (bottom left screw).

It can be seen that the middle of the high area is now at the bottom left screw, which means we just need to insert an equal number of stainless steel foil pieces under the top left and right screws.

After inserting 6 pieces of stainless steel foil under both the top left and right screws, it shows the following.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-4.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">Fig. 3<br>(13, 0, and 6 pieces of stainless steel foil inserted under the top left, bottom left, and right screws respectively)</span>
    </div>
</div>

- Area where marker is wiped off: full wipe, but the wiped width is obviously larger from 3 o'clock to 11 o'clock.
- Middle of the high area: 7 o'clock (bottom left screw).

It can be seen that the alignment has improved, but still shows the same trend (the high area is still at the bottom left screw) as the previous image. So I continued to insert 3 more pieces of stainless steel foil under both the top left and right screws, after which it shows the following.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-7.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">Fig. 4<br>(16, 0, and 9 pieces of stainless steel foil inserted under the top left, bottom left, and right screws respectively)</span>
    </div>
</div>

- Area where marker is wiped off: all parts except 3 o'clock.
- Middle of the high area: 9 o'clock.

It can be seen that the right screw has become the last low point. At this time, I inserted the last piece of stainless steel foil under the right screw and achieved a full wipe as shown below.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-8.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">Fig. 5<br>(16, 0, and 10 pieces of stainless steel foil inserted under the top left, bottom left, and right screws respectively)</span>
    </div>
</div>

- Area where marker is wiped off: full wipe achieved!

At this point, the chirp to lock distance has been successfully reduced to about 15 µm, which is considered almost perfect alignment (usually below 30 µm is considered perfect alignment). In the end, 16, 0, and 10 pieces of 5 µm stainless steel foil were inserted under the top left, bottom left, and right screws respectively.

I made the entire alignment process into a gif, as shown below:

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">

        <span class="image-span">Animation of the entire alignment process</span>
    </div>
</div>

It can be seen that the area where the marker is wiped off becomes larger and larger as more stainless steel foil is inserted, indicating that the alignment of the burrs is gradually improving.

#### Conclusion and Discussion

##### The Precision of the Lagom P100

When perfect alignment was achieved, 16 pieces of stainless steel foil had been inserted under the top left screw of the burr, with a total thickness of 80 µm. This doesn't seem to match OPTION-O's official guarantee of precision. The original text on their website is as follows:

>   **Every** critical part of the grinder is CNC-machined to a tolerance of <10 microns, with a flatness tolerance of < 5 microns. Each piece of CNC-machined parts is confirmed using industrial CMM (coordinate measuring machine) post-machining, or else they will be rejected. So we are confident the parts will be perfect. **No user alignment is required.**

But I don't blame them. Everything has tolerances, including the burrs made by SSP themselves. So it's extremely difficult to achieve near-perfect alignment on every machine like [Titus](https://www.titus-grinding.de/) or [zerno](https://zerno.co/).

I can only say, don't fully believe the grinder manufacturers... Doing your own alignment is not only reassuring but also a great learning experience!

##### The Difference Caused by Alignment and Its Necessity

So has the particle size distribution become more uniform after alignment? Does the coffee taste better? I think so, but to be honest, I'm not that confident, because it's hard to prove with data, and I usually don't consider sensory experience alone to be sufficient evidence.

Many people report that after burr alignment, the puck can withstand higher pressure at the same setting when making espresso, indicating that there are fewer boulders. But because my burrs couldn't make 9 bar espresso in the first place (98mm SSP Brew burrs have too few fines to build up enough pressure), I didn't test this.

For me, the biggest significance of aligning the burrs is actually being able to effectively rule out the grinder as a factor when the coffee is bad. In plain language, when the coffee doesn't taste good, I don't have to worry about whether it might be caused by the grinder. I think this is helpful for everyone's peace of mind (but at the same time, I also have one less excuse to blame for bad-tasting coffee, which is quite inconvenient).

Perhaps the real reason for alignment is just as mentioned in the [alignment tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb3PgeQ6ewY) I referred to earlier - it allows us, the coffee nerds, to finally sleep well, knowing our grinder is as aligned as it can be.
