#### The Most Anticipated Dripper of 2023: [NextLevel Pulsar](https://nextlevelbrewer.com/shop/nextlevel-pulsar-brewer/)

In *The Physics of Filter Coffee* (already [translated into Chinese](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010937126)), Jonathan Gagné mentioned his ideal dripper: [cylindrical to reduce bypass, even water distribution at the bottom to maximize filter paper usage, and a valve to control flow rate](https://coffeeadastra.com/2023/09/13/the-pulsar-dripper/). Surprisingly, NextLevel, the company behind the LVL-10 dripper, had readers among their ranks. They decided to collaborate and launch this dripper that Jonathan envisioned, naming it Pulsar, not only echoing Jonathan's profession as an astronomer but also alluding to its key feature with the homophone "Pause": the valve allows arbitrary control of water flow, even pausing it completely.

After the collaboration was announced, coffee enthusiasts worldwide began a long wait. Two years passed in the blink of an eye. Finally, in August 2023, Pulsar announced pre-orders. I quickly bought two, and after another month of waiting, I finally received them.

I immediately began exploring the Pulsar, but I must admit, the process was arduous and disappointing.

#### The Problems I Encountered with Pulsar

The general consensus on Pulsar is that it's good at reducing astringency, but I don't quite agree. In the recommended Pulsar recipes from Jonathan Gagné and most others<sup class="footnote-sup">[B]</sup>, there are many pours to maintain a low water level and reduce pressure, which Jonathan believes helps reduce astringency. But after many attempts and tweaks, I still felt the astringency was higher than I expected.

I suspect this is due to excessive agitation. Although multiple pours keep the water level low, they also increase agitation. Observing the coffee bed during brewing with similar recipes, you'll often find it not completely flat, which might lead to uneven water flow. **The core issue is Pulsar's height. To ensure sufficient capacity, the distance between Pulsar's disperser and the coffee bed is large, causing more agitation than I expected even with the disperser.**

Before getting the Pulsar, I expected it to be much better than the Tricolate (which took me a lot of time to dial-in), but after nearly 20 brews, I still felt the results weren't noticeably better in terms of both flavor and data, which was a bit disheartening.

#### Discussion with SEY

I happened to know that SEY was also testing the Pulsar recently, so I asked Lance about their recipe.

Lance's thoughts were similar to mine. He felt the biggest challenge was "how to achieve the highest extraction rate with minimal agitation," which was also the focus of my previous article. After many exchanges, revisions, and over 50 experiments of my own, this is the recipe I finally settled on.

#### Recipe Introduction

Here are the detailed parameters and brewing steps, most of which are identical to the previous recipe:

- Coffee to water ratio: 18g:360g (1:20)
    - Do not use more than 20g of coffee, as the Pulsar's capacity is insufficient and may overflow.

- Water temperature: 100°C
- Brewing water: distilled water, re-mineralized post-brew (minerals are added directly to the brewed coffee<sup class="footnote-sup">[C]</sup>).
    - Aim for water with 30–40GH, 15–20KH<sup class="footnote-sup">[D]</sup>, which equal amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>.
    - If unsure about water, normal tap water with a low TDS is acceptable.
- Grind size: Burr gap set between 150 to 200 µm from lock.
    - Similar to typical 9 bar espresso settings.
    - I used the Lagom P100 with the 98mm SSP Brew burrs, with grind settings between 2.0 and 3.0.
    - If your grinder produces more fines, consider a slightly coarser grind.
- Target concentration (TDS): 1.35%+
    - African beans can usually reach 1.45%+.

- Target extraction yield: 23.5%+
    - African beans can usually reach 25%+.

##### Required Equipment

-   Very lightly roasted coffee
    -   Since our goal is a very high extraction yield, it is necessary to ensure that the coffee tastes good at high extraction. In my experience, high extraction usually suits lighter roasted coffee better.
    -   Roasteries I've experimented with and had higher success rates: [SEY](https://www.seycoffee.com/), [Manhattan](https://manhattancoffeeroasters.com/), [Prodigal](https://getprodigal.com/).
-   Pulsar and its dedicated filter papers
-   Grinder, carafe, digital scale, and other basic pour-over equipment (you might not even need a pouring kettle!).
-   A WDT tool
    -   You can also use a spoon, chopsticks, or glass stick instead, something that can stir the coffee bed during the bloom.

##### Detailed Brewing Steps

1.   Separate the Pulsar's filter wall and base.
2.   Close the valve, pour a small amount of hot water into the base, just enough to submerge the ribs at the bottom.
3.   Place the filter paper inside, it will float on the water.
4.   Open the valve, the filter paper will adhere neatly to the bottom.
     -   This ensures there are no air bubbles between the valve and filter paper, allowing smoother water flow.
5.   Install the filter wall onto the base and close the valve.
6.   Measure 18g of coffee, grind, transfer to the filter, and level the grounds (a WDT tool is recommended).
7.   (With the valve closed) Place the disperser on top, pour in 100g of water in a large amount, and stir with a WDT tool or stirring rod to ensure all grounds are wet. Bloom for 1:00.
     -   If the coffee is very fresh, stir more carefully and evenly, otherwise the coffee bed may continue to bubble and form many small holes.
8.   Perform a gentle spin (i.e., Rao Spin) to ensure the coffee bed is flat.
9.   (With the valve closed) At 1:00, begin pouring slowly (about 2.5g/s) until reaching 360g. The pour should not finish before 2:30.
10.   Half-open the valve, about 1 to 2 o'clock (or 10 to 11 o'clock). The smaller the valve opening, the better, but there should be a smooth water flow (not dripping).
11.   Wait for the water to fully drain. The total brew time should be around 6–8 minutes.
12.   Re-mineralize using [Lotus Coffee Brew Water](https://lotuscoffeeproducts.com/), adding one drop each of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> solutions, and two drops of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, achieving roughly 15 ppm as CaCO<sub>3</sub> for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.

#### Recipe Design Thoughts

Below, I will introduce some of the unusual aspects of this recipe and the thoughts behind them.

##### Immersion-Style Bloom with a Large Amount of Water

Generally, the amount of water for blooming falls between 2.5 to 3.5 times the coffee dose. A bloom with a large amount of water might be considered "wasting water" and usually appears in recipes that don't aim for high extraction, such as [Patrik's April recipe](https://youtu.be/X-fXQKqkYxI).

However, the Pulsar has a key difference from other drippers: it has a "valve," and we bloom with the valve closed, ensuring all the water has sufficient contact time with the coffee.

This excess water serves an extremely important purpose: it ensures that the subsequent extraction is "low agitation." In the brewing process, I emphasized the need for WWDT or stirring during blooming to ensure all grounds are wet. If you've cupped or brewed Syphon, you'll notice that after thorough stirring, most of the suspended grounds begin to sink. Ideally, at the end of the bloom, all the grounds should be evenly settled at the bottom, and the water above acts as a buffer layer for the subsequent pour, further reducing agitation.

Therefore, during blooming, be sure to ensure the coffee bed is sunken and flat at the end of the bloom. If the coffee is too fresh and WWDT or stirring is not thorough, the coffee bed will continue to absorb water and bubble during brewing, causing an uneven bed and risking uneven water flow or channeling when opening the valve later. In such cases, consider more thorough WWDT or stirring.

##### Single Continuous Pour

A single continuous pour is also a technique commonly seen in low extraction recipes. It not only lacks the agitation of multiple pours but also tends to shorten the total extraction time due to the high flow rate caused by the high water level (after all, all the water is poured at once), both of which usually lead to a lower extraction yield.

But don't forget, the Pulsar has a "valve"! This means the flow rate is not entirely controlled by the water level height but also by the valve opening size. Therefore, we can ensure sufficient brewing time by opening the valve less.

The choice of a single continuous pour ultimately stems from our original intention of "low agitation." It ensures there is a sufficient buffer layer between the coffee bed and the water surface, and we pour very slowly throughout the entire process, further reducing agitation.

##### I know a single continuous pour isn't a bad choice, but why not use multiple pours?

I admit I was a bit evasive in the previous paragraph.

Although the overall process differs greatly, as I pointed out in the title, this recipe shares the same central idea and goal as my previous article [Achieving High Extraction with Low Agitation](https://whycoffee.blog/articles/%E4%BB%A5%E4%BD%8E%E6%93%BE%E5%8B%95%E9%81%94%E6%88%90%E9%AB%98%E8%90%83%E5%8F%96%E7%8E%87). To refresh your memory, in the previous recipe, we used the OREA V3 dripper, and the entire brew included five pours, including the bloom. So why does this recipe use such a peculiar single continuous pour?

Generally, increasing the number of pours produces the following three effects:

1.   Increases agitation, raising extraction efficiency.
     -   But this is something we want to avoid in this recipe, so it can be considered a "side effect" of multiple pours.
2.   Increases concentration gradient, raising extraction efficiency.
     -   When we pour, we add completely clean water to the dripper, and the concentration gradient between the water and coffee grounds is larger at this time.
3.   Lowers the average water level (because we pour less each time), reduces flow rate, increases total extraction time, and thus raises extraction yield.

In the original OREA recipe, the main purposes of multiple pours were 2. and 3., but it also produced the "side effect" of 1. As I mentioned in the previous section, with the Pulsar, I can achieve the purpose of increasing total extraction time in 3. by controlling the valve opening size, so the only advantage of multiple pours is 2. In my tests, I felt the "advantage" of 2. was not enough to compensate for the "disadvantage" of 1., which is why I finally adopted the single continuous pour method.

But the lack of concentration gradient also required me to use a finer grind to achieve a similar extraction yield. In the recipe from the previous article, I used a grind size of 200 to 300 µm, but in this Pulsar recipe, I used 150 to 200 µm, which may increase the bitterness and astringency of some beans. When this happens, I recommend trying to split the pour and use a slightly coarser grind.

##### So, is this a full immersion recipe?

When I first got the prototype of this recipe from Lance, my first question was, "Isn't this basically a full immersion recipe? Then why is blooming necessary?" Yes, generally, full immersion brews (or "near" full immersion, as most brews still go through filtration to remove fines) like inverted AeroPress or Syphon don't require blooming. But upon careful consideration, you'll realize this is not a full immersion recipe but a very slow percolation extraction (or a half immersion, half percolation extraction, with percolation likely making up the larger part). Why? Because there is no "immersion" process.

Immersion extraction is generally considered a low-efficiency extraction method because, by the middle of the extraction, it's basically "extracting coffee with coffee." Compared to percolation extraction's "extracting coffee with clean water," the lower concentration gradient results in lower extraction efficiency.

However, in this recipe, because we don't stir after the bloom and pour very slowly, it can be considered that we are gently "layering" the water on top. This keeps the concentration of the upper layer of water low, and most of the extraction occurs as the water passes through the coffee bed, similar to percolation extraction. How can we prove this? Observe the coffee flowing out. You'll notice that in the early stages of extraction, the coffee liquid is very dark, while the last liquid flowing out becomes extremely light. If it were full immersion extraction, the color of the coffee liquid should be similar regardless of when it flows out.

Because most of the extraction occurs during the percolation stage, blooming becomes necessary, and our immersion-style bloom with a large amount of water can further reduce agitation, as mentioned earlier.

#### Conclusion

This recipe differs greatly from the one introduced in the previous article [Achieving High Extraction with Low Agitation](https://whycoffee.blog/articles/%E4%BB%A5%E4%BD%8E%E6%93%BE%E5%8B%95%E9%81%94%E6%88%90%E9%AB%98%E8%90%83%E5%8F%96%E7%8E%87), but they are based on similar concepts and thus have a similar flavor profile, with "transparent, complex, sweet" as the overall extraction goal.

In my own attempts, this recipe is more convenient (after all, it only requires pouring once) but has a lower success rate. Some beans will produce excessive bitterness no matter how I adjust using this recipe. I haven't figured it out yet, so I welcome everyone to try it and discuss it with me<sup class="footnote-sup">[E]</sup>! Perhaps we can further improve this method together.
