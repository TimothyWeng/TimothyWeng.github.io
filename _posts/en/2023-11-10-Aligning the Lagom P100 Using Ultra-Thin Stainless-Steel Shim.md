</div>

This article discusses how to perform parallel alignment using a marker test and stainless steel foil. I've detailed the process of aligning the 98mm SSP Brew burr set in National Taiwan University's Coffee Club's Lagom P100. If you own this grinder, you'll likely find the process beneficial, but even with a different grinder, this article should serve as a valuable reference.

#### The Importance of Parallelism

During grinding, coffee beans fall into the burrs' central hole, are propelled outward by inertia, and ground until their size is smaller than the gap between the burrs, at which point they exit as coffee grounds.

Thus, the parallelism of the burrs is crucial. If the burrs are misaligned, the gap on each side will differ, causing the ground coffee particle size to vary and reducing grind uniformity, as shown in the illustration below.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">

    </div>
</div>

In the bottom right picture, the burrs are misaligned: the gap is wider on the right and narrower on the left, so the coffee ground from the right side will be larger, leading to uneven grinding.

#### Chirp to Lock Distance

How can we objectively describe the burrs' parallelism? A common indicator is the "chirp to lock" distance, the gap between the burr's chirping point and locking point.

##### Chirp Point

The chirp point is often the zero point on your grinder's scale. You find it by turning on the grinder and gradually reducing the grind size until the burrs touch and produce a sharp sound, known as chirping. This point on the dial is the chirp point.

Since the burrs are typically very hard, this procedure shouldn't damage them, but be careful not to adjust any finer to avoid potentially damaging the motor.

##### Lock Point

After finding the chirp point, turn off the grinder (important!). You'll notice you can still adjust the grind finer; the distance you can move until it won't turn further is the chirp to lock distance. The point where it can't move any further is the lock point.

For example, before parallel alignment, the P100's lock point was at -0.8 when I couldn't turn the dial anymore, and the chirp point was at 0, making the chirp to lock distance 0.8. Knowing that each step on the P100 represents a 75 µm gap between the burrs, the distance was around 60 µm.

In essence, a smaller chirp to lock distance with similar burr sizes and structures suggests that closer alignment results in more uniform grounds, which is crucial for consistent brewing quality.

#### How to Perform a Marker Test and Adjust Alignment Using Shims

A common method to check burr alignment is the marker test, which uses a marker (dry erase marker) to verify alignment.

Clarification: while we often discuss "parallelism," it's essential that both burrs are parallel and each perpendicular to the axis. One burr is fixed, and the other rotates; if they are not perpendicular to the axis, they may appear parallel at a certain angle but will be misaligned once rotating.

Thus, the marker test is not only checking for parallelism but also whether the burrs are perpendicular to the axis. The process is straightforward: apply marker ink on the flat edge of the burr undergoing alignment, reassemble, and start the grinder to find the chirp point. After slight contact, remove the burr to inspect. If the ink is evenly removed, it indicates alignment; if only partially removed, it suggests a high point, typically centered within the erased area.

Adjustment involves adding shims opposite the high point to even out the burr, repeating until a full wipe is achieved, indicating the burr is perpendicular and aligned.

Example below:

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-1.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">Burr post-marker test</span>
    </div>
</div>

Upon detailed observation, you'll notice that the marker ink has been erased approximately from the 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock direction, suggesting the high point is at the 6 o'clock position. This means we need to add shims at the 12 o'clock position. Since there isn't a screw exactly at 12 o'clock, we typically start with the screw closest to this position, which is the top left screw.

It's crucial to note that shims should only be inserted under the screws (usually a piece of equal thickness on either side of a screw) because placing a shim between two screws could risk bending the burr. The downward force exerted by the screws on either side could create a fulcrum point with the shim in the middle, potentially warping the burr.

The logic of this method is straightforward: keep adding shims at lower areas until the burr becomes parallel. However, on closer examination, this process is incredibly tedious and time-consuming as it requires numerous disassemblies and reassemblies of the grinder (but this is an unavoidable part of the task).

Since it's challenging to convey the entire process clearly through text alone, I highly recommend watching this classic [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb3PgeQ6ewY) before attempting the operation yourself.

#### Why Stainless Steel Foil?

Shim size is typically 0.5 cm * 1 cm, often cut from aluminum foil for its availability and consistency in thickness. However, I found aluminum foil's stability lacking during adjustments, as alignment seemed to degrade over time, resembling compression.

While it's debated physically, many noted aluminum's instability. Influential coffee blogger Rohan suggested in [an article](https://pocketsciencecoffee.com/2023/03/23/superjolly-bearing-replacement-part-2-alignment/) using stainless steel over aluminum foil, prompting me to switch and re-align using stainless steel, hence this article's inception.

#### Detailed Adjustment Process

The following details the process of aligning the Lagom P100's 98mm SSP Brew burrs. I believe that even if you are using a different grinder, most of these steps will still be of reference value.<sup class="footnote-sup">[D]</sup>

It is crucial to emphasize again: each of the two burrs needs to be aligned separately. The burr that you apply the whiteboard marker to is the one being aligned. To achieve better parallelism, both burrs need to achieve a full wipe. The reason for separate alignments is that each burr must be perpendicular to the axis.

##### Required Materials

##### Required Materials

- Whiteboard marker
- Torque screwdriver (I used the [Wera 7441 torque screwdriver](https://24h.pchome.com.tw/prod/DEACFQ-A900A9GRS))
  - A torque screwdriver ensures consistent force is applied each time the burrs are assembled or disassembled, making the alignment process more stable. However, it's not essential; a standard screwdriver can also be used.
  - Regarding the choice of torque, I followed the OPTION-O factory recommendation of 2.5N⋅m for adjusting, which is suitable for 98mm burrs. If your burrs are smaller, a setting of 2N⋅m might be more appropriate.
- Screwdriver bit
  - Choose a bit that fits the screws of your grinder. The P100 and most 98mm grinders use the PH3 screw specification.
- Stainless steel foil
  - Thinner foils can achieve a more precise parallel alignment but are also more time-consuming to use.
  - I utilized a higher-priced, ultra-thin 5 µm stainless steel foil.

##### Dismantling the P100's Upper Burr (Skip if not applicable)

Fortunately, the lower burr was already showing a full wipe before any adjustment was made, so there was no need to disassemble it. However, I immediately encountered difficulties when trying to remove the upper burr after unscrewing it. The burr was stuck very tightly and could not be pulled out.

After contacting customer service, they explained that the issue was likely due to coffee fines and oils creating a vacuum-like seal under the burr, making it impossible to remove due to air pressure. At this point, it's necessary to use a softer object (I used the handle of a screwdriver that has a soft grip) to tap the back of the burr. This vibration can effectively break the vacuum seal, thereby making the burr easier to remove.

This information is shared to aid those facing similar issues with the P100.

##### Beginning the Marker Test and Inserting Stainless Steel Shims

Now we officially start the marker test. I have recorded the results of each marker test and noted under which screws I have inserted the shims. These photos have been aligned and had their backgrounds removed using Photoshop for easy comparison.

Before starting the correction, it's crucial to remember the relative position between the burr and its seat. This means ensuring the burr is not rotated out of position after each lock because the burr itself has tolerances, and any arbitrary change in position can affect parallelism.

Here is the state before any alignment adjustment, with the chirp to lock distance about 60 µm:

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-1.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">Figure 1<br>(No stainless steel foil inserted yet)</span>
    </div>
</div>

- Range of ink removal: approximately from 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock direction.
- Midpoint of the high area: 6 o'clock direction.

The upper half-circle appears lower, requiring the insertion of shims at the 12 o'clock direction. However, there isn't a screw directly at 12 o'clock, so I start with the closest one at the top left and observe the changes in the marker test.

After inserting 7 pieces of stainless steel foil under the top left screw, the marker test shows the following image:

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-3.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">Figure 2<br>(7 pieces, 0 pieces, and 0 pieces of stainless steel foil were inserted under the top left, bottom left, and right screws respectively)</span>
    </div>
</div>

- Range of ink removal: approximately from 3 o'clock to 11 o'clock direction.
- Midpoint of the high area: 7 o'clock direction (bottom left screw).

It's observed that the midpoint of the higher area is now at the bottom left screw. Thus, we need to add equal amounts of stainless steel foil under the top left and right screws next.

After adding 6 pieces of stainless steel foil under both the top left and right screws, we observe the following image:

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-4.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">Figure 3<br>(13 pieces, 0 pieces, and 6 pieces of stainless steel foil inserted respectively under the top left, bottom left, and right screws)</span>
    </div>
</div>

- Range of ink removal: full wipe but notably wider from 3 o'clock to 11 o'clock.
- Midpoint of the high area: 7 o'clock direction (bottom left screw).

The non-parallel condition has improved, but the pattern remains similar to the previous image. Therefore, I continued adding 3 more pieces of stainless steel foil under both the top left and right screws, resulting in the next image.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-7.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">Figure 4<br>(16 pieces, 0 pieces, and 9 pieces of stainless steel foil inserted respectively)</span>
    </div>
</div>

- Range of ink removal: all except for the 3 o'clock direction.
- Midpoint of the high area: 9 o'clock direction.

The right screw appears to be the final low point. By inserting one last piece of stainless steel foil under the right screw, a full wipe is achieved as shown below:

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-8.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">Figure 5<br>(16 pieces, 0 pieces, and 10 pieces of stainless steel foil inserted respectively)</span>
    </div>
</div>

- Range of ink removal: full wipe achieved!

At this point, the chirp to lock distance has been successfully reduced to about 15 µm, indicating nearly perfect parallelism (usually below 30 µm is considered perfect). 16 pieces, 0 pieces, and 10 pieces of 5 µm stainless steel foil were inserted under the top left, bottom left, and right screws respectively.

I created a gif of the entire adjustment process as follows:

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment.gif" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">The entire adjustment process in animation</span>
    </div>
</div>

This illustrates how the area with removed ink expands with increasing amounts of stainless steel foil, showing a gradual improvement in the burr's parallelism.

#### Conclusion and Discussion

##### Precision of the Lagom P100

When achieving perfect parallelism, I had to insert 16 stainless steel shims under the screw at the top left corner of the burr, totaling 80 µm in thickness. This does not seem to align with OPTION-O's official precision claims, which state the following:

> **Every** critical part of the grinder is CNC-machined to a tolerance of <10 microns, with a flatness tolerance of < 5 microns. Each piece of CNC-machined parts is confirmed using industrial CMM (coordinate measuring machine) post-machining, or else they will be rejected. So we are confident the parts will be perfect. **No user alignment is required.**

However, I do not fault them as every manufacturing process has its tolerances, including the burrs made by SSP. Achieving near-perfect parallelism like machines from [Titus](https://www.titus-grinding.de/) or [zerno](https://zerno.co/) is an incredibly high standard.

In essence, it might be best to maintain a healthy skepticism towards manufacturers' claims... Aligning the machine yourself is not only reassuring but also an enriching learning experience!

##### The Difference and Necessity of Parallel Alignment

So, did the alignment make the grind size more uniform? Did it improve the taste of the coffee? I believe it did, but I must admit that I am not entirely confident, as these claims are hard to substantiate with data, and I tend to believe that sensory experiences alone are not sufficient evidence.

Many report that after burr alignment, they can apply higher pressure to the espresso puck at the same grinder setting, indicating fewer fines. However, since my burrs could not produce a 9 bar espresso (the 98mm SSP Brew burrs produce too few fines to build adequate pressure), I did not test this aspect.

To me, the greatest value of alignment lies in its ability to rule out the grinder as a variable when coffee quality is lacking. In plain terms, when the coffee tastes off, I can confidently eliminate the grinder from the list of potential culprits, which I think is beneficial for everyone's mental well-being (though it also removes an easy excuse for bad coffee).

Perhaps the real reason for alignment, as mentioned in the [alignment tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb3PgeQ6ewY) I referenced earlier, is that it allows us coffee nerds to finally sleep well, knowing our grinder is precisely tuned.
