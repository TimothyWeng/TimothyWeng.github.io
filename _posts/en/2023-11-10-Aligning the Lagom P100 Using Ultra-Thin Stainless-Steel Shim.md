This article will discuss how to use marker tests and stainless-steel shim for aligning flat burr grinders. I have also detailed the process of aligning the 98mm SSP Brew burr set in the National Taiwan University Coffee Club's Lagom P100. If you happen to have this grinder, I believe the alignment process will be very helpful to you, but even if you have a different grinder, this article should serve as a good reference.

#### The Importance of Alignment

During grinding, coffee beans fall into the center hole of the burr set and are propelled outward by inertia while being ground by the burrs until their size is less than the gap between the burrs, after which they exit the burr set as the coffee powder we see.

Therefore, the alignment of the burr set is quite important. If the burrs are not aligned, the gap on either side will not be the same, which leads to a slight difference in the particle size of the coffee powder on either side, decreasing grind uniformity, as shown below.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">

    </div>
</div>

In the bottom right image, the two burrs are not aligned: the gap is larger on the right side and smaller on the left, so the coffee particles ground on the right will be larger than those on the left, leading to uneven grinding.

#### Chirp to Lock Distance

So how do we objectively describe the alignment of the burrs? A common indicator is the chirp to lock distance, which is the distance between the burr chirp point and lock point.

##### Chirp Point

The chirp point is usually set to the grinder's zero scale mark, which is when, with the grinder turned on, the grind setting is slowly adjusted finer until the burrs rub against each other, producing a sharp noise (also called a chirping sound). This mark is considered the chirp point.

The burrs are usually very hard, so this procedure does not damage them, but be careful not to continue adjusting finer to avoid damaging the motor if the burrs lock.

##### Lock Point

After finding the chirp point, we can **turn off the grinder** (be sure to turn it off!). At this point, you can still adjust the grinder finer, and the point at which it can no longer be adjusted is the chirp to lock distance. The scale at which it cannot move any further is the grinder's lock point.

For example, before completing the alignment, the P100 at the National Taiwan University Coffee Club had a lock point at -0.8 when adjusted finer until the dial could not turn any further, with the chirp point at 0, making the chirp to lock distance 0.8. On the P100, each scale represents a 75 µm gap between the burrs, so the chirp to lock distance is about 60 µm.

Generally, for burrs of the same size and structure (e.g., 98mm SSP Brew burrs), the smaller the chirp to lock distance, the more aligned the burrs. This is intuitive because a smaller chirp to lock distance means the burrs are still not rubbing against each other even when very close, indicating better alignment.

#### How to Perform a Marker Test and Use Shims for Alignment

A common method to check the alignment of burr sets is called the marker test, as the name suggests, using a marker (dry erase marker) for inspection.

Firstly, it's crucial to clarify that while we often discuss alignment in terms of parallelism, it's not only about the burrs being parallel to each other; they also need to be perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This is because one of the burrs is stationary, while the other rotates. Thus, even if they appear parallel at a certain relative angle, they will not be parallel once the burr starts rotating.

Hence, the marker test is not solely about checking if the burrs are parallel but also if they are perpendicular to the axis. The procedure is straightforward: apply the marker on the flat edge of one burr (the one being aligned) and reassemble it into the grinder. After starting the grinder and finding the chirp point, causing slight friction, remove the burr. If it is perpendicular to the axis, the marker ink should be uniformly removed, a state we call a full wipe. Conversely, if the ink is only removed at one spot, that indicates the first point of contact during adjustment, the higher point of the burr. We usually consider the midpoint of the erased ink area as the burr's high point.

We aim to place shims on the lower side of the burr, so at this point, we add shims under the screw on the opposite side of the high point, making the burr more aligned. Repeat this process until achieving a full wipe. This indicates that the burr is perpendicular to the axis. Following the same method to adjust the other burr ensures alignment.

Consider the following image as an example:

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-1.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">Burr immediately after a marker test</span>
    </div>
</div>

On close inspection, if the marker ink is removed approximately from the 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock direction, the high point is at 6 o'clock. This means we need to add shims at the 12 o'clock position. Since there is no screw exactly at 12 o'clock, we start by adding height at the closest screw to 12 o'clock (the top left screw).

It is crucial to only place shims under the screws (usually one thin shim on each side of the screw) because adding a shim between two screws could bend the burr: the force exerted by the screws would press the burr down, and the shim in the middle would act as a fulcrum, causing the burr to bend.

The logic is simple: continue to add shims at the lower points until the burr is aligned. However, this process is meticulous and time-consuming because it involves numerous disassemblies and reassemblies of the grinder (but... it's necessary).

Text alone cannot clarify the process thoroughly, so it's highly recommended to watch this classic [instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb3PgeQ6ewY) before actual implementation.

#### Why Use Stainless Steel Shims?

Shim sizes are generally 0.5 cm x 1 cm, often made from aluminum foil because it's readily available and meets the thinness and consistent thickness criteria. However, I found that using aluminum foil introduces considerable uncertainty in the alignment process; even after achieving a full wipe, the aligned state is not maintained for long. Months later, the previously higher area might return to being higher, as if the aluminum foil compressed over time.

While I'm unsure if this is physically plausible, many have observed the instability of aluminum foil. The well-known coffee blogger rohan also advocated in [an article](https://pocketsciencecoffee.com/2023/03/23/superjolly-bearing-replacement-part-2-alignment/) for using stainless steel shims over aluminum foil. Additionally, finding even thinner stainless steel shims than aluminum foil convinced me to replace the aluminum with stainless steel shims for realignment, prompting this article.

#### Detailed Alignment Process

Here is the process for aligning the 98mm SSP Brew burrs of the Lagom P100, but most steps should be applicable regardless of the grinder model used.

To reiterate: each burr needs to be aligned separately. The burr marked with the dry erase marker is the one being aligned. To achieve optimal alignment, both burrs need to reach a full wipe state. They need to be aligned separately because they must both be perpendicular to the rotation axis.

  <div class="footnote-content">I also aligned the [Fellow Ode](https://fellowproducts.com/products/ode-brew-grinder) at the National Taiwan University Coffee Club using the exact same method.</div>
</div>

##### Required Materials

- Dry erase marker
- Torque screwdriver (I used the [Wera 7441 torque screwdriver](https://24h.pchome.com.tw/prod/DEACFQ-A900A9GRS))
    - A torque screwdriver ensures consistent torque is applied every time the burrs are assembled or disassembled, making the alignment process more stable. However, it's not mandatory; a standard screwdriver can also be used.
    - Regarding the torque value, I used 2.5N⋅m recommended by OPTION-O specifically for 98mm burrs. If your burrs are smaller, a torque of 2N⋅m might suffice.
- Screwdriver bit
    - Choose a bit that fits your grinder. The P100 and most 98mm grinders use PH3 screw size.
- Stainless steel shims
    - Thinner shims can achieve more precise alignment but are also more time-consuming to adjust.
    - I used a higher-priced, ultra-thin 5 µm stainless steel shim.

##### How to Remove the Upper Burr of the P100 (Skip this section if not using P100)

Fortunately, the lower burr showed a full wipe before adjustment, so there was no need to dismantle it. However, I encountered difficulties when attempting to remove the upper burr. After unscrewing, the burr was stuck and couldn't be pulled out.

After contacting customer service, they explained that coffee fines and oils can create a near-vacuum state under the burr, making it impossible to remove due to air pressure. In such cases, tapping the back of the burr with a soft object (I used the handle of the screwdriver, which had a soft pad) can effectively break the vacuum, making the burr easier to remove.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">

        <span class="image-span">Response from the official technician</span>
    </div>
</div>

This issue was a significant challenge for me, so I've documented it here for reference by other P100 users encountering the same problem.

##### Starting the Marker Test and Inserting Stainless Steel Shims

Next, I began the marker test, recording each result and where I added shims under the screws. These photos have been aligned and had their backgrounds removed in Photoshop for easier comparison.

Before starting the alignment, remember the relative position of the burr to its seat, ensuring it is not rotated out of position each time it's locked in place. The burr itself has tolerances, so changing its relative position can affect alignment.

This was the condition before alignment, with the chirp to lock distance at about 60 µm.

</div>

- The range where the ink was removed: approximately from 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock direction.
- The midpoint of the higher area: 6 o'clock direction.

The upper half-circle appears lower, necessitating the addition of a shim at the 12 o'clock direction. Since there's no screw there, I chose to start by placing a stainless steel shim under the screw closest to the lowest point (the top-left screw) and observe the changes in the marker test.

After placing 7 stainless steel shims under the top-left screw, the marker test showed the following image.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-3.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">
        <span class="image-span">Figure 2<br>(7, 0, and 0 stainless steel shims placed under the top-left, bottom-left, and right screws respectively)</span>
    </div>
</div>

- The range where the ink was removed: approximately from 3 o'clock to 11 o'clock direction.
- The midpoint of the higher area: 7 o'clock direction (bottom-left screw).

The middle point of the higher area is now at the bottom-left screw, indicating that equal amounts of shims should be placed under the top-left and right screws next.

After placing an additional 6 shims each under the top-left and right screws, the image below was obtained.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-4.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">

    </div>
</div>

- The range where the ink was removed: full wipe, but the area from 3 o'clock to 11 o'clock direction shows a wider clearance.
- The midpoint of the higher area: 7 o'clock direction (bottom-left screw).

There's improvement in alignment, but the same trend persists. Thus, I added 3 more shims each under the top-left and right screws, resulting in the following image.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">

    </div>
</div>

- The range where the ink was removed: all but the 3 o'clock direction.
- The midpoint of the higher area: 9 o'clock direction.

The right screw is identified as the final low point. After placing one last shim under the right screw, a full wipe was achieved as shown below.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/alignment-8.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid responsive-image">

    </div>
</div>

- The range where the ink was removed: full wipe achieved!

The chirp to lock distance was successfully reduced to about 15 µm, representing near-perfect alignment (usually, below 30 µm is considered perfect). A total of 16, 0, and 10 stainless steel shims, each 5 µm thick, were placed.

I compiled the entire alignment process into a gif as shown below:

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-12 mt-md-4 mt-3 mb-md-4 mb-3 text-center">

        <span class="image-span">The entire alignment process in a gif</span>
    </div>
</div>

The area where the ink was removed gradually increased with more shims, showing an improvement in alignment.

#### Conclusion and Discussion

##### Precision of the Lagom P100

To achieve perfect alignment, 16 stainless steel shims were placed under the top-left screw, totaling 80 µm in thickness. This seems to contradict OPTION-O's official precision claims, which state:

> **Every** critical part of the grinder is CNC-machined to a tolerance of <10 microns, with a flatness tolerance of < 5 microns. Each piece of CNC-machined parts is confirmed using industrial CMM (coordinate measuring machine) post-machining, or else they will be rejected. So we are confident the parts will be perfect. **No user alignment is required.**

However, I don't blame them; everything has tolerances, including the SSP-manufactured burrs. Therefore, achieving near-perfect parallelism for every machine, similar to brands like [Titus](https://www.titus-grinding.de/) or [zerno](https://zerno.co/), is an incredibly high standard.

In essence, don't just take the manufacturers' word for it... Aligning the grinder yourself is not only reassuring but also a great learning experience!

##### The Impact of Alignment and Its Necessity

So, did the particle size distribution improve after alignment? Did the coffee taste better? I believe so, but honestly, I'm not entirely confident as this is hard to prove with data, and I usually consider sensory experiences alone insufficient as evidence.

Many report that after burr alignment, the coffee puck can withstand higher pressure at the same grinder setting when making espresso, indicating fewer coarse particles. However, since my burrs couldn't produce 9 bar espresso shots to begin with (the 98mm SSP Brew burrs produce too few fines to build adequate pressure), I didn't test this aspect.

For me, the greatest significance of aligning the burrs is to effectively eliminate the grinder as a variable when the coffee isn't ideal. In layman's terms, when the coffee tastes off, I don't have to worry if it's due to the grinder. I think this is beneficial for everyone's peace of mind (though it also removes one potential excuse for bad coffee, which can be inconvenient).

Perhaps the real reason for burr alignment, as mentioned in the [alignment tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb3PgeQ6ewY) I referenced earlier, is that it allows us, the coffee nerds, to finally sleep well, knowing our grinder is as precise as it can be.
